Wildcards

You can use wildcards to catch multiple URLs with the same pattern.
For example, you can use the following URL pattern to catch all API requests to
JSON Placeholder API:

https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/*

Excluding URLs

You can exclude URLs with ! to prevent them from being intercepted.
For example, you can exclude the URL https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/authors
by using the following URL pattern:

!https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/authors
https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/*

Intercepted URLs:

https://ghcr.io/token?scope=repository%3Aocicl%2Fcl-ppcre%3Apull
https://ghcr.io/v2/ocicl/cl-ppcre/tags/list?n=1024
