Description: Modern ASDF system distribution and management tool for Common Lisp
 ocicl is a modern tool for Common Lisp development that provides:
  * Package management: A modern alternative to quicklisp for ASDF system
    distribution and management
  * Code linting: An integrated linter that checks your code for style issues,
    common errors, and best practices
  * Project scaffolding: Template-based project creation to quickly start new
    applications
 .
 All software is packaged as OCI-compliant artifacts and distributed from
 mirrored OCI-compliant registries. All software packages are securely
 distributed over TLS connections and sigstore is used to ensure the integrity
 and authenticity of all software packages.
