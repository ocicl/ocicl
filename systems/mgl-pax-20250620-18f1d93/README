# PAX Manual

###### [in package MGL-PAX with nicknames PAX]

## Introduction

What if documentation really lived in the code?

Docstrings are already there. If some narrative glued them together,
we'd be able develop and explore the code along with the
documentation due to their physical proximity. The main tool that
PAX provides for this is DEFSECTION:

    (defsection @foo-random-manual (:title "Foo Random manual")
      "Foo Random is a random number generator library."
      (foo-random-state class)
      (uniform-random function)
      (@foo-random-examples section))

Like this one, sections can have docstrings and
references to
definitions (e.g. (UNIFORM-RANDOM FUNCTION)). These docstrings and
references are the glue. To support interactive development, PAX

- makes SLIME's M-. work with references and

- adds a documentation browser.

See Emacs Setup.

Beyond interactive workflows, Generating Documentation from
sections and all the referenced items in Markdown or HTML format is
also implemented.

With the simplistic tools provided, one may emphasize the narrative
as with Literate Programming, but documentation is generated from
code, not vice versa, and there is no support for chunking.

Code is first, code must look pretty, documentation is code.

##### Docstrings

PAX automatically recognizes and marks up code with
backticks and links names in code to their definitions.
Take, for instance, SBCL's ABORT function, whose docstring is
written in the usual style, uppercasing names of symbols:

    (docstring #'abort)
    => "Transfer control to a restart named ABORT, signalling
    a CONTROL-ERROR if none exists."

Note how in the generated documentation, ABORT is set with a
monospace font, while CONTROL-ERROR is Autolinked:

- [function] ABORT &OPTIONAL CONDITION

    Transfer control to a restart named ABORT, signalling
    a CONTROL-ERROR if none exists.

[6bc0]: http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/e_contro.htm "CONTROL-ERROR CONDITION"

The following transcript shows the raw Markdown for
the previous example.

    (document #'abort :format :markdown)
    .. - [function] **ABORT** *&OPTIONAL CONDITION*
    ..
    ..     Transfer control to a restart named `ABORT`, signalling
    ..     a [`CONTROL-ERROR`][7c2c] if none exists.
    ..
    ..   [7c2c]: http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/e_contro.htm "CONTROL-ERROR (MGL-PAX:CLHS CONDITION)"
    ..

##### A Complete Example

Here is an example of how it all works together:

    (mgl-pax:define-package :foo-random
      (:documentation "This package provides various utilities for random.
      See FOO-RANDOM:@FOO-RANDOM-MANUAL.")
      (:use #:common-lisp #:mgl-pax))
    
    (in-package :foo-random)
    
    (defsection @foo-random-manual (:title "Foo Random manual")
      "FOO-RANDOM is a random number generator library inspired by CL:RANDOM.
      Functions such as UNIFORM-RANDOM use *FOO-STATE* and have a
      :RANDOM-STATE keyword arg."
      (foo-random-state class)
      (state (reader foo-random-state))
      "Hey we can also print states!"
      (print-object (method (foo-random-state t)))
      (*foo-state* variable)
      (gaussian-random function)
      (uniform-random function)
      ;; This is a subsection.
      (@foo-random-examples section))
    
    (defclass foo-random-state ()
      ((state :reader state)))
    
    (defmethod print-object ((object foo-random-state) stream)
      (print-unreadable-object (object stream :type t)))
    
    (defvar *foo-state* (make-instance 'foo-random-state)
      "Much like *RANDOM-STATE* but uses the FOO algorithm.")
    
    (defun uniform-random (limit &key (random-state *foo-state*))
      "Return a random number from the between 0 and LIMIT (exclusive)
      uniform distribution."
      nil)
    
    (defun gaussian-random (stddev &key (random-state *foo-state*))
      "Return a random number from a zero mean normal distribution with
      STDDEV."
      nil)
    
    (defsection @foo-random-examples (:title "Examples")
      "Let's see the transcript of a real session of someone working
      with FOO:
    
      ```cl-transcript
      (values (princ :hello) (list 1 2))
      .. HELLO
      => :HELLO
      => (1 2)
    
      (make-instance 'foo-random-state)
      ==> #<FOO-RANDOM-STATE >
      ```")

Note how (VARIABLE *FOO-STATE*) in the DEFSECTION form both
exports *FOO-STATE* and includes its documentation in
@FOO-RANDOM-MANUAL. The symbols VARIABLE and
FUNCTION are just two instances of locatives,
which are used in DEFSECTION to refer to definitions tied to
symbols.

(DOCUMENT @FOO-RANDOM-MANUAL) generates fancy Markdown or HTML
output with automatic markup and Autolinks uppercase words found in docstrings,
numbers sections, and creates a table of contents.

One can even generate documentation for different but related
libraries at the same time with the output going to different files
but with cross-page links being automatically added for symbols
mentioned in docstrings. In fact, this is what PAX World does. See
Generating Documentation for some convenience functions to cover
the most common cases.

The transcript in the code block tagged with
cl-transcript is automatically checked for up-to-dateness when
documentation is generated.

## Links and Systems

Here is the [official
repository](https://github.com/melisgl/mgl-pax) and the [HTML
documentation](http://melisgl.github.io/mgl-pax-world/mgl-pax-manual.html)
for the latest version. There is also a PAX channel on
youtube with a couple of videos.

PAX is built on top of the DRef library (bundled in the same repository).

- Installation for deployment

    The base system is mgl-pax. It has very few
    dependencies and is sufficient as a dependency for systems using
    the Basics to add documentation. This is to keep deployed code
    small. To install only the bare minimum, with no intention of
    using Navigating Sources in Emacs, Generating Documentation,
    Browsing Live Documentation or using Transcripts, under
    Quicklisp for example, PAX could be installed as:

        (ql:quickload "mgl-pax")

- Installation for development

    The heavier dependencies are on the other systems, which
    correspond to the main functionalities provided, intended to be
    used primarily during development. To install the dependencies
    for all features under Quicklisp, do

        (ql:quickload "mgl-pax/full")

    Having thus installed the dependencies, it is enough to load the
    base system, which will autoload the other systems as necessary.

## Emacs Setup

Here is a quick recipe for setting up PAX for use via SLIME to
take advantage of the conveniences on offer.
Conversely, there is no need to do any of this just to use
DEFSECTION, write docstrings and for Generating Documentation.

If PAX was installed from Quicklisp, then evaluate this in CL to
install the Elisp code in a stable location:

    (mgl-pax:install-pax-elisp "~/quicklisp/")

Assuming the Elisp file is in the ~/quicklisp/ directory, add
something like this to your .emacs:

    (add-to-list 'load-path "~/quicklisp/")
    (require 'mgl-pax)
    (global-set-key (kbd "C-.") 'mgl-pax-document)
    (global-set-key (kbd "s-x t") 'mgl-pax-transcribe-last-expression)
    (global-set-key (kbd "s-x r") 'mgl-pax-retranscribe-region)

When Browsing with Other Browsers, for clicking on the locative
next to a definition to visit the corresponding source location in
Emacs, permission needs to be given:

    (setq slime-enable-evaluate-in-emacs t)

### Functionality Provided

- For Navigating Sources in Emacs, loading mgl-pax extends
  slime-edit-definitions (M-.) by adding
  mgl-pax-edit-definitions to slime-edit-definition-hooks. There
  are no related variables to customize.

- For Browsing Live Documentation, mgl-pax-browser-function and
  mgl-pax-web-server-port can be customized in Elisp. To browse
  within Emacs, choose w3m-browse-url (see w3m), and make sure
  both the w3m binary and the w3m Emacs package are installed. On
  Debian, simply install the w3m-el package. With other browser
  functions, a HUNCHENTOOT web server is started.

- See Transcribing with Emacs for how to use the transcription
  features. There are no related variables to customize.

Independently from the Common Lisp side, the Elisp functions
mgl-pax-hideshow-documentation and mgl-pax-hideshow-comments
help focus on the code only by folding or unfolding
MGL-PAX:DEFSECTION, MGL-PAX:DEFINE-GLOSSARY-TERM forms and long
strings, or comments.

### Installing from Quicklisp

If you installed PAX with Quicklisp, the location of mgl-pax.el
may change with updates, and you may want to copy the current
version of mgl-pax.el to a stable location by evaluating this in
CL:

    (mgl-pax:install-pax-elisp "~/quicklisp/")

If working from, say, a git checkout, there is no need for this
step.

- [function] INSTALL-PAX-ELISP TARGET-DIR

    Install mgl-pax.el distributed with this package in TARGET-DIR.

### Loading PAX

Assuming the Elisp file is in the ~/quicklisp/ directory, add
something like this to your .emacs:

    (add-to-list 'load-path "~/quicklisp/")
    (require 'mgl-pax)

If the Elisp variable mgl-pax-autoload is true (the default), then
PAX will be loaded in the connected Lisp on-demand via SLIME.

If loading fails, mgl-pax will be unloaded from Emacs and any
overridden Slime key bindings restored.

### Setting up Keys

The recommended key bindings are this:

    (global-set-key (kbd "C-.") 'mgl-pax-document)
    (global-set-key (kbd "s-x t") 'mgl-pax-transcribe-last-expression)
    (global-set-key (kbd "s-x r") 'mgl-pax-retranscribe-region)

The global key bindings above are global because their commands work
in any mode. If that's not desired, one may bind C-. locally in
all Slime related modes like this:

    (slime-bind-keys slime-parent-map nil '(("C-." mgl-pax-document)))

If the customizable variable mgl-pax-hijack-slime-doc-keys is
true, then upon loading mgl-pax, the following changes are made to
slime-doc-map (assuming it's bound to C-c C-d):

- C-c C-d a: replaces slime-apropos with mgl-pax-apropos

- C-c C-d z: replaces slime-apropos-all with mgl-pax-apropos-all

- C-c C-d p: replaces slime-apropos-package with mgl-pax-apropos-package

- C-c C-d f: replaces slime-describe-function with mgl-pax-document

- C-c C-d d: replaces slime-describe-symbol with
   mgl-pax-hideshow-documentation

- C-c C-d c: installs mgl-pax-hideshow-comments

- C-c C-d u: installs mgl-pax-edit-parent-section

Calling mgl-pax-unhijack-slime-doc-keys reverts these changes.

## Background

As a user, I frequently run into documentation that's incomplete
and out of date, so I tend to stay in the editor and explore the
code by jumping around with SLIME's M-. (slime-edit-definition).
As a library author, I spend a great deal of time polishing code but
precious little writing documentation.

In fact, I rarely write anything more comprehensive than docstrings
for exported stuff. Writing docstrings feels easier than writing a
separate user manual, and they are always close at hand during
development. The drawback of this style is that users of the library
have to piece the big picture together themselves.

That's easy to solve, I thought, let's just put all the narrative
that holds docstrings together in the code and be a bit like a
Literate Programmer turned inside out. The original prototype, which
did almost everything I wanted, was this:

    (defmacro defsection (name docstring)
      `(defun ,name () ,docstring))

Armed with this DEFSECTION, I soon found myself
organizing code following the flow of user-level documentation and
relegated comments to implementation details entirely. However, some
parts of DEFSECTION docstrings were just listings of
all the functions, macros and variables related to the narrative,
and this list was repeated in the DEFPACKAGE form complete with
little comments that were like section names. A clear violation of
OAOO, one of them had to go, so DEFSECTION got a list
of symbols to export.

That was great, but soon I found that the listing of symbols is
ambiguous if, for example, a function, a compiler macro and a class
were named by the same symbol. This did not concern exporting, of
course, but it didn't help readability. Distractingly, on such
symbols, M-. was popping up selection dialogs. There were two
birds to kill, and the symbol got accompanied by a type, which was
later generalized into the concept of locatives:

    (defsection @introduction ()
      "A single line for one man ..."
      (foo class)
      (bar function))

After a bit of elisp hacking, M-. was smart enough to
disambiguate based on the locative found in the vicinity of the
symbol, and everything was good for a while.

Then, I realized that sections could refer to other sections if
there were a SECTION locative. Going down that path, I soon began to
feel the urge to generate pretty documentation as all the necessary
information was available in the DEFSECTION forms. The design
constraint imposed on documentation generation was that following
the typical style of upcasing symbols in docstrings, there should be
no need to explicitly mark up links: if M-. works, then the
documentation generator shall also be able figure out what's being
referred to.

I settled on Markdown as a reasonably non-intrusive format, and a
few thousand lines later PAX was born. Since then, locatives and
references were factored out into the DRef
library to let PAX focus on M-. and documentation.

## Basics

Now let's examine the most important pieces.

- [macro] DEFSECTION NAME (&KEY (PACKAGE '*PACKAGE*) (READTABLE '*READTABLE*) (EXPORT T) TITLE LINK-TITLE-TO (DISCARD-DOCUMENTATION-P *DISCARD-DOCUMENTATION-P*)) &BODY ENTRIES

    Define a documentation section and maybe export referenced symbols.
    A bit behind the scenes, a global variable with NAME is defined and
    is bound to a SECTION object. By convention, section names
    start with the character @. See Introduction for an example.

    Entries

    ENTRIES consists of docstrings and references in any order.
    Docstrings are arbitrary strings in Markdown format.

    References are XREFs given in the form (NAME LOCATIVE).
    For example, (FOO FUNCTION) refers to the function FOO, (@BAR
    SECTION) says that @BAR is a subsection of this
    one. (BAZ (METHOD (T T T))) refers to the default method of the
    three argument generic function BAZ. (FOO FUNCTION) is
    equivalent to (FOO (FUNCTION)). See the DRef Introduction
    for more.

    The same name may occur in multiple references, typically with
    different locatives, but this is not required.

    The references are not LOCATEd until documentation is generated, so
    they may refer to things yet to be defined.

    Exporting

    If EXPORT is true (the default), NAME and the names of references
    among ENTRIES which are SYMBOLs are candidates for exporting. A
    candidate symbol is exported if

    - it is accessible in PACKAGE, and

    - there is a reference to it in the section being defined which is
      approved by EXPORTABLE-REFERENCE-P.

    See DEFINE-PACKAGE if you use the export feature. The idea with
    confounding documentation and exporting is to force documentation of
    all exported symbols.

    Misc

    TITLE is a string containing Markdown or NIL. If non-NIL, it
    determines the text of the heading in the generated output.
    LINK-TITLE-TO is a reference given as an (NAME LOCATIVE) pair or
    NIL, to which the heading will link when generating HTML. If not
    specified, the heading will link to its own anchor.

    When DISCARD-DOCUMENTATION-P (defaults to *DISCARD-DOCUMENTATION-P*)
    is true, ENTRIES will not be recorded to save memory.

- [variable] *DISCARD-DOCUMENTATION-P* NIL

    The default value of DEFSECTION's DISCARD-DOCUMENTATION-P argument.
    One may want to set *DISCARD-DOCUMENTATION-P* to true before
    building a binary application.

- [macro] DEFINE-PACKAGE PACKAGE &REST OPTIONS

    This is like CL:DEFPACKAGE but silences warnings and errors
    signalled when the redefined package is at variance with the current
    state of the package. Typically this situation occurs when symbols
    are exported by calling EXPORT (as is the case with DEFSECTION) as
    opposed to adding :EXPORT forms to the DEFPACKAGE form and the
    package definition is subsequently reevaluated. See the section on
    [package variance](http://www.sbcl.org/manual/#Package-Variance) in
    the SBCL manual.

    The bottom line is that if you rely on DEFSECTION to do the
    exporting, then you'd better use DEFINE-PACKAGE.

- [macro] DEFINE-GLOSSARY-TERM NAME (&KEY TITLE URL (DISCARD-DOCUMENTATION-P *DISCARD-DOCUMENTATION-P*)) &BODY DOCSTRING

    Define a global variable with NAME, and set it to a GLOSSARY-TERM object. TITLE, URL and DOCSTRING are Markdown strings or
    NIL. Glossary terms are DOCUMENTed in the lightweight bullet +
    locative + name/title style. See the glossary entry name for an
    example.

    When a glossary term is linked to in documentation, its TITLE will
    be the link text instead of the name of the symbol (as with
    SECTIONs).

    Glossary entries with a non-NIL URL are like external links: they
    are linked to their URL in the generated documentation. These offer
    a more reliable alternative to using Markdown reference links and
    are usually not included in SECTIONs.

    When DISCARD-DOCUMENTATION-P (defaults to *DISCARD-DOCUMENTATION-P*)
    is true, DOCSTRING will not be recorded to save memory.

- [macro] NOTE &BODY ARGS

    Define a note with an optional NAME and an optional
    DOCSTRING. The DOCSTRING of the note is its
    own docstring concatenated with docstrings of other notes in the
    lexical scope of BODY.

    ARGS has the form [NAME] [DOCSTRING] BODY, where the square
    brackets indicate optional arguments. See below for the details of
    parsing ARGS.

    NOTE is experimental and as such subject to change.

    NOTE can occur in an any evaluated position without changing its
    BODY's run-time behaviour or introducing any run-time overhead. Top
    level forms remain top level when whrapped in NOTE. The names
    of notes live in the same global namespace regardless of nesting or
    whether they are top level forms. These properties come at
    the price of NOTE being weird: it defines named notes at
    macro-expansion time (or load time). But the definitions are
    idempotent, so it's fine to macroexpand NOTE any number of times.

    Notes are similar to Lisp comments, but they can be included in the
    documentation. In fact, notes are auto-included: a Specific Link to
    a note is equivalent to including it with the DOCSTRING locative.

    Notes are intended to help reduce the distance between code and its
    documentation when there is no convenient definition docstring to
    use nearby.

        (note @xxx "We change the package."
          (in-package :mgl-pax))
        ==> #<PACKAGE "MGL-PAX">
        (values (docstring (dref '@xxx 'note)))
        => "We change the package."

    Here is an example of how to overdo things:

        (note @1+*
          "This is a seriously overdone example."
          (defun 1+* (x)
            "[@1+* note][docstring]"
            (if (stringp x)
                (note (@1+*/1 :join #\Newline)
                  "- If X is a STRING, then it is parsed as a REAL number."
                  (let ((obj (read-from-string x)))
                    (note "It is an error if X does not contain a REAL."
                      (unless (realp obj)
                        (assert nil)))
                    (1+ obj)))
                (note "- Else, X is assumed to be REAL number, and we simply
                         add 1 to it."
                  (1+ x)))))
        
        (1+* "7")
        => 8
        
        (values (docstring (dref '@1+* 'note)))
        => "This is a seriously overdone example.
        
        - If X is a STRING, then it is parsed as a REAL number.
        It is an error if X does not contain a REAL.
        
        - Else, X is assumed to be REAL number, and we simply
        add 1 to it."

    The parsing of ARGS:

    - If the first element of ARGS is not a string, then it is a NAME (a
      non-NIL SYMBOL) or name with options, currently destructured
      as (NAME &KEY JOIN). As in DEFSECTION and DEFINE-GLOSSARY-TERM,
      the convention is that NAME starts with a @ character.

        JOIN is PRINCed before the docstring of a child note is output.
        Its default value is a string of two newline characters.

    - The next element of ARGS is a Markdown docstring. See
      Markdown in Docstrings.

    - The rest of ARGS is the BODY. If BODY is empty, then NIL is
      returned.

    Note that named and nameless notes can contain other named or
    nameless notes without restriction, but nameless notes without a
    lexically enclosing named note are just an implicit progn
    with BODY, and their docstring is discarded.

    If NOTE occurs as a top level form, then its SOURCE-LOCATION
    is reliably recorded. Else, the quality of the source location
    varies, but it is at least within the right top level form on all
    implementations. On SBCL, exact source location is supported.

## PAX Locatives

To the Basic Locative Types defined by DRef,
PAX adds a few of its own.

- [locative] SECTION

    - Direct locative supertypes: VARIABLE

    Refers to a SECTION defined by DEFSECTION.

    SECTION is EXPORTABLE-LOCATIVE-TYPE-P but not exported by
    default (see EXPORTABLE-REFERENCE-P).

- [locative] GLOSSARY-TERM

    - Direct locative supertypes: VARIABLE

    Refers to a GLOSSARY-TERM defined by DEFINE-GLOSSARY-TERM.

    GLOSSARY-TERM is EXPORTABLE-LOCATIVE-TYPE-P but not exported by
    default (see EXPORTABLE-REFERENCE-P).

- [locative] NOTE

    Refers to named notes defined by the NOTE macro.

    If a single link would be made to a NOTE (be it either a
    Specific Link or an unambiguous Unspecific Link), then the NOTE's
    DOCSTRING is included as if with the DOCSTRING locative.

    NOTE is EXPORTABLE-LOCATIVE-TYPE-P but not exported by default (see
    EXPORTABLE-REFERENCE-P).

- [locative] DISLOCATED

    Refers to a symbol in a non-specific context. Useful for
    suppressing Unspecific Autolinking. For example, if there is a
    function called FOO then

        `FOO`

    will be linked (if *DOCUMENT-LINK-CODE*) to its definition. However,

        [`FOO`][dislocated]

    will not be. With a dislocated locative, LOCATE always fails with a
    LOCATE-ERROR condition. Also see Escaping Autolinking.

    DISLOCATED references do not RESOLVE.

- [locative] ARGUMENT

    An alias for DISLOCATED, so that one can refer to an
    argument of a macro without accidentally linking to a class that has
    the same name as that argument. In the following example,
    FORMAT may link to CL:FORMAT (if we generated
    documentation for it):

        "See FORMAT in DOCUMENT."

    Since ARGUMENT is a locative, we can prevent that linking by writing:

        "See the FORMAT argument of DOCUMENT."

    ARGUMENT references do not RESOLVE.

- [locative] INCLUDE SOURCE &KEY LINE-PREFIX HEADER FOOTER HEADER-NL FOOTER-NL

    This PSEUDO locative refers to a region of a file. SOURCE can be a
    STRING or a PATHNAME, in which case the whole file
    is being pointed to, or it can explicitly supply START, END
    locatives. INCLUDE is typically used to include non-lisp files in
    the documentation (say Markdown or Elisp as in the next example) or
    regions of Lisp source files. This can reduce clutter and
    duplication.

        (defsection @example-section ()
          (mgl-pax.el (include #.(asdf:system-relative-pathname
                                  :mgl-pax "src/mgl-pax.el")
                               :header-nl "```elisp" :footer-nl "```"))
          (foo-example (include (:start (dref-ext:make-source-location function)
                                 :end (dref-ext:source-location-p function))
                                :header-nl "```"
                                :footer-nl "```")))

    In the above example, when documentation is generated, the entire
    src/mgl-pax.el file is included in the Markdown output surrounded
    by the strings given as HEADER-NL and FOOTER-NL. The documentation
    of FOO-EXAMPLE will be the region of the file from the
    SOURCE-LOCATION of the START reference (inclusive) to the
    SOURCE-LOCATION of the END reference (exclusive). If only one of
    START and END is specified, then they default to the beginning and
    end of the file, respectively.

    Since START and END are literal references, pressing M-. on
    PAX.EL will open the src/mgl-pax.el file and put the cursor on
    its first character. M-. on FOO-EXAMPLE will go to the source
    location of the FOO function.

    With the LAMBDA locative, one can specify positions in arbitrary
    files.

    - SOURCE is either an absolute pathname designator or a list
      matching the destructuring lambda list (&KEY START END),
      where START and END must be NIL or (<NAME> <LOCATIVE>)
      lists (not evaluated) like a DEFSECTION entry. Their
      SOURCE-LOCATIONs constitute the bounds of the region of the file
      to be included. Note that the file of the source location of START
      and END must be the same. If SOURCE is a pathname designator, then
      it must be absolute so that the locative is context independent.

    - If specified, LINE-PREFIX is a string that's prepended to each
      line included in the documentation. For example, a string of four
      spaces makes Markdown think it's a code block.

    - HEADER and FOOTER, if non-NIL, are printed before the included
      string.

    - HEADER-NL and FOOTER-NL, if non-NIL, are printed between two
      FRESH-LINE calls.

    INCLUDE is not EXPORTABLE-LOCATIVE-TYPE-P, and INCLUDE references do
    not RESOLVE.

- [locative] DOCSTRING

    DOCSTRING is a PSEUDO locative for including the parse tree of
    the Markdown DOCSTRING of a definition in the parse tree
    of a docstring when generating documentation. It has no source
    location information and only works as an explicit link. This
    construct is intended to allow docstrings to live closer to their
    implementation, which typically involves a non-exported definition.

        (defun div2 (x)
          "X must be [even* type][docstring]."
          (/ x 2))
        
        (deftype even* ()
          "an even integer"
          '(satisfies evenp))
        
        (document #'div2)
        .. - [function] DIV2 X
        ..
        ..     X must be an even integer.
        ..

    There is no way to LOCATE DOCSTRINGs, so nothing to RESOLVE either.

- [locative] GO (NAME LOCATIVE)

    Redirect to a definition in the context of the reference
    designated by NAME and LOCATIVE. This PSEUDO locative is intended for
    things that have no explicit global definition.

    As an example, consider this part of a hypothetical documentation of
    CLOS:

        (defsection @clos ()
          (defmethod macro)
          (call-next-method (go (defmethod macro))))

    The GO reference exports the symbol CALL-NEXT-METHOD and also
    produces a terse redirection message in the documentation.

    GO behaves as described below.

    - A GO reference RESOLVEs to what NAME with LOCATIVE resolves to:

            (resolve (dref 'xxx '(go (print function))))
            ==> #<FUNCTION PRINT>
            => T

    - The DOCSTRING of a GO reference is NIL.

    - SOURCE-LOCATION (thus M-.) returns the source location of the
      embedded reference:

            (equal (source-location (dref 'xxx '(go (print function))))
                   (source-location (dref 'print 'function)))
            => T

- [locative] CLHS &OPTIONAL NESTED-LOCATIVE

    Refers to definitions, glossary entries, sections, issues and
    issue summaries in the Common Lisp HyperSpec. These have no source
    location so M-. will not work. What works is linking in
    documentation, including Browsing Live Documentation. The generated
    links are relative to *DOCUMENT-HYPERSPEC-ROOT* and work even if
    *DOCUMENT-LINK-TO-HYPERSPEC* is NIL. All matching is
    case-insensitive.

    - definitions: These are typically unnecessary as DOCUMENT will
      produce the same link for e.g. PPRINT, [PPRINT][function],
      or [PPRINT][] if *DOCUMENT-LINK-TO-HYPERSPEC* is non-NIL and the
      PPRINT function in the running Lisp is not linkable. When
      Browsing Live Documentation, a slight difference is that
      everything is linkable, so using the CLHS link bypasses the page
      with the definition in the running Lisp.

        - unambiguous definition: [pprint][clhs] (pprint)

        - disambiguation page: [function][clhs] (function)

        - specific: [function][(clhs class)] (function)

    - glossary terms:

        - [lambda list][(clhs glossary-term)]
          (lambda list)

    - issues:

        - [ISSUE:AREF-1D][clhs] (ISSUE:AREF-1D)

        - [ISSUE:AREF-1D][(clhs section)] (ISSUE:AREF-1D)

    - issue summaries: These render
       as (SUMMARY:CHARACTER-PROPOSAL:2-6-5):

        - [SUMMARY:CHARACTER-PROPOSAL:2-6-5][clhs]

        - [SUMMARY:CHARACTER-PROPOSAL:2-6-5][(clhs section)]

        Since these summary ids are not particularly reader friendly,
        the anchor text a Specific Reflink with Text may be used:

        - [see this][SUMMARY:CHARACTER-PROPOSAL:2-6-5 (clhs section)]
          (see this).

    - sections:

        - by section number: [3.4][clhs] or [3.4][(clhs
          section)] (3.4)

        - by section title: With the locative (CLHS SECTION),
          substring matching against the title starting at word
          boundaries is performed. With the locative CLHS (where
          SECTION is not specified explicitly), the name must match
          the title exactly. For example, [lambda list][(clhs
          section)] refers to the same definition as [lambda
          lists][clhs] (Lambda Lists).

        - by filename: [03_d][clhs] or [03_d][(clhs
          section)] (03_d)

        - by alias

            - Format directives are aliases of
              the sections describing them. Thus, [~c][clhs] is
              equivalent to [22.3.1.1][clhs] and [Tilde C:
              Character][clhs]. The full list is
              ~C ~% ~& ~|
            ~~ ~R ~D ~B
            ~O ~X ~F ~E
            ~G ~$ ~A ~S
            ~W ~_ ~< ~:>
            ~I ~/ ~T ~< Justification
            ~> ~* ~[ ~]
            ~{ ~} ~? ~(
            ~) ~P ~; ~^
            ~Newline.

            - Similarly, reader macro characters are aliases of
              the sections describing them. The full list is
              ( ) ' ;
            " ` , #
            #\\ #' #( #*
            #: #. #B #O
            #X #R #C #A
            #S #P #= ##
            #+ #- #| #<
            #).

            - Finally, loop keywords have
              aliases to the sections describing them. For example, the
              strings loop:for, for and :for are aliases of CLHS
              6.1.2.1. The loop:* aliases are convenient for
              completion at the prompt when
              Browsing Live Documentation, while the other aliases are
              for defaulting to buffer contents.

    As the above examples show, the NESTED-LOCATIVE argument of the CLHS
    locative may be omitted. In that case, definitions, glossary terms,
    issues, issue summaries, and sections are considered in that order.
    Sections are considered last because a substring of a section title
    can be matched by chance easily.

    All examples so far used Reflinks. Autolinking also works if the
    name is marked up as code or is codified (e.g. in
    COS clhs (COS clhs).

    As mentioned above, M-. does not do anything over CLHS
    references. Slightly more usefully, the live documentation
    browser understands CLHS links so one
    can enter inputs like 3.4 clhs, "lambda list" clhs or
    error (clhs function).

    CLHS references do not RESOLVE.

## Navigating Sources in Emacs

Integration into SLIME's M-. (slime-edit-definition) allows
one to visit the SOURCE-LOCATION of a definition. PAX extends
standard Slime functionality by

- adding support for all kinds of definitions (see e.g.
  ASDF:SYSTEM, READTABLE in
  Basic Locative Types), not just the ones Slime knows about,

- providing a portable way to refer to even standard definitions,

- disambiguating the definition based on buffer content, and

- adding more powerful completions.

The definition is either determined from the buffer content at point
or is prompted for. At the prompt, TAB-completion is available for
both names and locatives. With a prefix argument (C-u M-.), the
buffer contents are not consulted, and M-. always prompts.

The M-. extensions can be enabled by loading src/mgl-pax.el. See
Emacs Setup. In addition, the Elisp command
mgl-pax-edit-parent-section visits the source location of the
section containing the definition with point in it.

A close relative of M-. is C-. for Browsing Live Documentation.

### M-. Defaulting

When M-. is invoked, it first tries to find a name in the
current buffer at point. If no name is found, then it
prompts.

First, (slime-sexp-at-point) is taken as a word, from which the
name will be parsed. Then, candidate locatives are
looked for before and after the word. Thus, if a locative is the
previous or the next expression, then M-. will go straight to the
definition which corresponds to the locative. If that fails, M-.
will try to find the definitions in the normal way, which may
involve popping up an xref buffer and letting the user interactively
select one of possible definitions.

M-. works on parenthesized references, such as those in
DEFSECTION:

    (defsection @foo ()
      (cos function))

Here, when the cursor is on one of the characters of COS or just
after COS, pressing M-. will visit the definition of the
function COS.

To play nice with Generating Documentation, forms suitable for
Autolinking are recognized:

    function cos
    cos function

... as well as Reflinks:

    [cos][function]
    [see this][cos function]

... and Markdown inline code:

    cos `function`
    `cos` function
    `cos` `function`

Everything works the same way in comments and docstrings as in code.
In the next example, pressing M-. on RESOLVE* will visit its
denoted method:

    ;;; See RESOLVE* (method (function-dref)) for how this all works.

### M-. Prompting

#### M-. Minibuffer Syntax

At the minibuffer prompt, the definitions to edit
can be specified as follows.

- NAME: Refers to all DREF:DEFINITIONS of NAME with a Lisp locative
  type. See these NAME -> DEFINITIONS
  examples:

        print    ->  PRINT FUNCTION
        PRINT    ->  PRINT FUNCTION
        MGL-PAX  ->  "mgl-pax" ASDF:SYSTEM, "MGL-PAX" package
        pax      ->  "PAX" PACKAGE
        "PAX"    ->  "PAX" PACKAGE

    Note that depending on the Lisp implementation there may be more
    definitions. For example, SBCL has an UNKNOWN
    :DEFOPTIMIZER definition for PRINT.

- NAME LOCATIVE: Refers to a single definition (as in (DREF:DREF
  NAME LOCATIVE)). Example inputs of this form:

        print function
        dref-ext:docstring* (method (t))

- LOCATIVE NAME: This has the same form as the previous: two sexps,
  but here the first one is the locative. If ambiguous, this is
  considered in addition to the previous one. Example inputs:

        function print
        (method (t)) dref-ext:docstring*

In all of the above NAME is a raw name, meaning that print
will be recognized as PRINT and pax as "PAX".

The package in which symbols are read is the Elisp
slime-current-package. In Lisp buffers, this is the buffer's
package, else it's the package of the Slime repl buffer.

#### M-. Completion

When M-. prompts for the definition to edit, TAB-completion is
available in the minibuffer for both names and locatives. To reduce
clutter, string names are completed only if they are typed
explicitly with an opening quotation mark, and they are
case-sensitive. Examples:

- pri<TAB> invokes the usual Slime completion.

- print <TAB> (note the space) lists FUNCTION and (PAX:CLHS
  FUNCTION) as locatives.

- class dref:<TAB> lists DREF:XREF and DREF:DREF (all the classes
  in the package DREF).

- pax:locative <TAB> lists all locative types (see the CL
  function DREF:LOCATIVE-TYPES).

- package "MGL<TAB> lists the names of packages that start with
  "MGL".

- package <TAB> lists the names of all packages as strings and
   also CLASS, MGL-PAX:LOCATIVE because PACKAGE denotes a class and
   also a locative.

For more powerful search, see Apropos.

## Generating Documentation

### The DOCUMENT Function

- [function] DOCUMENT DOCUMENTABLE &KEY (STREAM T) PAGES (FORMAT :PLAIN)

    Write DOCUMENTABLE in FORMAT to STREAM diverting some output to PAGES.
    FORMAT is one of :PLAIN,
    :MARKDOWN, :HTML and
    :PDF or NIL. STREAM may be a
    STREAM object, T or NIL as with CL:FORMAT.

    To look up the documentation of the DOCUMENT function itself:

        (document #'document)

    The same with fancy markup:

        (document #'document :format :markdown)

    To document a SECTION:

        (document pax::@pax-manual)

    To generate the documentation for separate libraries with automatic
    cross-links:

        (document (list pax::@pax-manual dref::@dref-manual) :format :markdown)

    See Utilities for Generating Documentation for more.

    Definitions that do not define a first-class object are supported
    via DRef:

        (document (dref:locate 'foo 'type))

    There are quite a few special variables that affect how output is
    generated, see Codification, Linking to the HyperSpec,
    Linking to Sections, Link Format and Output Formats.

    For the details, see the following sections, starting with
    DOCUMENTABLE. Also see Writing Extensions and DOCUMENT-OBJECT*.

#### DOCUMENTABLE

The DOCUMENTABLE argument of DOCUMENT may be a single object (e.g.
#'PRINT'), a definition such as (DREF 'PRINT 'FUNCTION),
a string, or a nested list of these. More precisely, DOCUMENTABLE is
one of the following:

- single definition designator: A DREF or anything else
  that is LOCATEable. This includes non-DREF XREFs and
  first-class objects such as FUNCTIONs. The generated
  documentation typically includes the definition's DOCSTRING. See
  Markdown Output for more.

- docstring: A string, in which case it is processed like a
  docstring in DEFSECTION. That is, with docstring sanitization, Codification, and Linking.

- list of documentables: A nested list of LOCATEable objects and
  docstrings. The objects in it are documented in depth-first order.
  The structure of the list is otherwise unimportant.

- [variable] *DOCUMENT-TIGHT* NIL

    If NIL, then DOCUMENT adds a newline between consecutive
    atomic documentables on the same page.

#### Return Values

If PAGES are NIL, then DOCUMENT - like CL:FORMAT - returns a
string (when STREAM is NIL) else NIL.

If PAGES, then a list of output designators are returned, one for
each non-empty page (to which some output has been written), which
are determined as follows.

- The string itself if the output was to a string.

- The stream if the output was to a stream.

- The pathname of the file if the output was to a file.

If the default page given by the STREAM argument of DOCUMENT was
written to, then its output designator is the first element of the
returned list. The rest of the designators correspond to the
non-empty pages in the PAGES argument of DOCUMENT in that order.

#### PAGES

The PAGES argument of DOCUMENT is to create multi-page documents
by routing some of the generated output to files, strings or
streams. PAGES is a list of page specification elements. A page spec
is a property list with keys :OBJECTS, :OUTPUT,
:URI-FRAGMENT, :SOURCE-URI-FN, :HEADER-FN and :FOOTER-FN. OBJECTS is
a list of objects (references are allowed but not required) whose
documentation is to be sent to :OUTPUT.

PAGES may look something like this:

    `((;; The section about SECTIONs and everything below it ...
       :objects (, @sections)
       ;; ... is so boring that it's not worth the disk space, so
       ;; send it to a string.
       :output (nil)
       ;; Explicitly tell other pages not to link to these guys.
       :uri-fragment nil)
      ;; Send the @EXTENSION-API section and everything reachable
      ;; from it ...
      (:objects (, @extension-api)
       ;; ... to build/tmp/pax-extension-api.html.
       :output "build/tmp/pax-extension-api.html"
       ;; However, on the web server html files will be at this
       ;; location relative to some common root, so override the
       ;; default:
       :uri-fragment "doc/dev/pax-extension-api.html"
       ;; Set html page title, stylesheet, charset.
       :header-fn 'write-html-header
       ;; Just close the body.
       :footer-fn 'write-html-footer)
      ;; Catch references that were not reachable from the above. It
      ;; is important for this page spec to be last.
      (:objects (, @pax-manual)
       :output "build/tmp/manual.html"
       ;; Links from the extension api page to the manual page will
       ;; be to ../user/pax-manual#<anchor>, while links going to
       ;; the opposite direction will be to
       ;; ../dev/pax-extension-api.html#<anchor>.
       :uri-fragment "doc/user/pax-manual.html"
       :header-fn 'write-html-header
       :footer-fn 'write-html-footer))

Documentation is initially sent to a default stream (the STREAM
argument of DOCUMENT), but output is redirected if the thing being
currently documented is the :OBJECT of a PAGE-SPEC.

- :OUTPUT can be a number things:

    - If it's NIL, then output will be collected in a string.

    - If it's T, then output will be sent to *STANDARD-OUTPUT*.

    - If it's a stream, then output will be sent to that stream.

    - If it's a list whose first element is a string or a pathname, then
      output will be sent to the file denoted by that and the rest of
      the elements of the list are passed on to CL:OPEN. One extra
      keyword argument is :ENSURE-DIRECTORIES-EXIST. If it's true,
      ENSURE-DIRECTORIES-EXIST will be called on the pathname before
      it's opened.

    Note that even if PAGES is specified, STREAM acts as a catch all,
    absorbing the generated documentation for references not claimed by
    any pages.

- :HEADER-FN, if not NIL, is a function of a single stream argument,
  which is called just before the first write to the page. Since
  :FORMAT :HTML only generates HTML fragments, this makes it
  possible to print arbitrary headers, typically setting the title,
  CSS stylesheet, or charset.

- :FOOTER-FN is similar to :HEADER-FN, but it's called after the
   last write to the page. For HTML, it typically just closes the
   body.

- :URI-FRAGMENT is a string such as "doc/manual.html" that specifies
  where the page will be deployed on a webserver. It defines how
  links between pages will look. If it's not specified and :OUTPUT
  refers to a file, then it defaults to the name of the file. If
  :URI-FRAGMENT is NIL, then no links will be made to or from that
  page.

- :SOURCE-URI-FN is a function of a single, DREF argument.
  If it returns a value other than NIL, then it must be a string
  representing an URI. This affects *DOCUMENT-MARK-UP-SIGNATURES*
  and *DOCUMENT-FANCY-HTML-NAVIGATION*. Also see
  MAKE-GIT-SOURCE-URI-FN.

#### Package and Readtable

While generating documentation, symbols may be read (e.g. from
docstrings) and printed. What values of *PACKAGE* and *READTABLE*
are used is determined separately for each definition being
documented.

- If the values of *PACKAGE* and *READTABLE* in effect at the time
  of definition were captured (e.g. by DEFINE-LOCATIVE-TYPE and
  DEFSECTION), then they are used.

- Else, if the definition has a Home Section (see below), then the
  home section's SECTION-PACKAGE and SECTION-READTABLE are used.

- Else, if the definition has an argument list, then the package of
  the first argument that's not external in any package is used.

- Else, if the definition is named by a symbol, then its
  SYMBOL-PACKAGE is used, and *READTABLE* is set to the standard
  readtable (NAMED-READTABLES:FIND-READTABLE :COMMON-LISP).

- Else, *PACKAGE* is set to the CL-USER package and *READTABLE* to
  the standard readtable.

The values thus determined come into effect after the name itself is
printed, for printing of the arglist and the docstring.

    CL-USER> (pax:document #'foo)
    - [function] FOO <!> X Y &KEY (ERRORP T)
    
        Do something with X and Y.

In the above, the <!> marks the place where *PACKAGE* and
*READTABLE* are bound.

##### Home Section

The home section of an object is a SECTION that contains the
object's definition in its SECTION-ENTRIES or NIL. In the
overwhelming majority of cases there should be at most one
containing section.

If there are multiple containing sections, the following apply.

- If the name of the definition is a non-keyword symbol, only
  those containing sections are considered whose package is closest
  to the SYMBOL-PACKAGE of the name, where closest is defined as
  having the longest common prefix between the two PACKAGE-NAMEs.

- If there are multiple sections with equally long matches or the
  name is not a non-keyword symbol, then it's undefined which one is
  the home section.

For example, (MGL-PAX:DOCUMENT FUNCTION) is an entry in the
MGL-PAX::@BASICS section. Unless another section that contains
it is defined in the MGL-PAX package, the home section is guaranteed
to be MGL-PAX::@BASICS because the SYMBOL-PACKAGEs of
MGL-PAX:DOCUMENT and MGL-PAX::@BASICS are the same (hence their
common prefix is maximally long).

This scheme would also work, for example, if the home package
of DOCUMENT were MGL-PAX/IMPL, and it were reexported from
MGL-PAX because the only way to externally change the home package
would be to define a containing section in a package like
MGL-PAX/IMP.

Thus, relying on the package system makes it possible to find the
intended home section of a definition among multiple containing
sections with high probability. However, for names which are not
symbols, there is no package system to advantage of.

- [variable] *DOCUMENT-NORMALIZE-PACKAGES* T

    Whether to print [in package <package-name>] in the documentation
    when the package changes.

### Browsing Live Documentation

Documentation for definitions in the running Lisp can be browsed
directly without generating documentation in the offline manner.
HTML documentation, complete with Codification and Linking, is
generated from docstrings of all kinds of definitions and PAX
SECTIONs in the running Lisp on the fly. This allows ad-hoc
exploration of the Lisp, much like describe-function,
apropos-command and other online help commands in Emacs, for which
direct parallels are provided.

Still, even without Emacs and SLIME, limited functionality can be
accessed through PAX Live Home Page by starting the live
documentation web server manually.

If Emacs Setup has been done, the Elisp function
mgl-pax-document (maybe bound to C-.) generates and displays
documentation as a single HTML page. If necessary, a disambiguation
page is generated with the documentation of all matching
definitions. For example, to view the documentation of this very
SECTION, one can do:

    M-x mgl-pax-document
    View Documentation of: pax::@browsing-live-documentation

Alternatively, pressing C-. with point over the text
pax::@browsing-live-documentation in a buffer achieves the same
effect.

In interactive use, mgl-pax-document behaves similarly to
M-. except:

- It shows the DOCUMENTation of some definition and does not visit
  its SOURCE-LOCATION.

- It considers definitions with all LOCATIVE-TYPES not just
  LISP-LOCATIVE-TYPES because it doesn't need SOURCE-LOCATION.

    This also means that completion works for CLHS
    definitions:

    - "lambda list<TAB> lists "lambda list" and "lambda list
      keywords", both HyperSpec glossary entries. This is similar
      to common-lisp-hyperspec-glossary-term in Elisp but also
      works for HyperSpec section titles.

    - "#<TAB> lists all sharpsign reader macros (similar to
      common-lisp-hyperspec-lookup-reader-macro in Elisp).

    - "~<TAB> lists all CL:FORMAT directives (similar to
      common-lisp-hyperspec-format in Elisp).

    - "loop:~<TAB> lists all loop keywords.

- It works in non-lisp-mode buffers by reinterpreting a few lines
  of text surrounding point as lisp code (hence the suggested
  global binding).

- It supports fragment syntax at the prompt:

        NAME LOCATIVE FRAGMENT-NAME FRAGMENT-LOCATIVE

    This is like NAME LOCATIVE, but the browser scrolls to the
    definition of FRAGMENT-NAME FRAGMENT-LOCATIVE within that
    page.

    For example, entering this at the prompt will generate the
    entire PAX manual as a single page and scroll to the very
    section you are reading within it:

        pax::@pax-manual pax:section pax::@browsing-live-documentation pax:section

- If the empty string is entered at the prompt, and there is no
  existing w3m buffer or w3m is not used, then PAX Live Home Page
  is visited. If there is a w3m buffer, then entering the empty
  string displays that buffer.

The convenience function
mgl-pax-current-definition-toggle-view (C-c C-d c) documents the
definition with point in it.

#### Browsing with w3m

When the value of the Elisp variable mgl-pax-browser-function
is w3m-browse-url (see Emacs Setup), the Emacs w3m browser is
used without the need for a web server, and also offering somewhat
tighter integration than Browsing with Other Browsers.

With w3m's default key bindings, moving the cursor between links involves
TAB and S-TAB (or <up> and <down>). RET and <right>
follow a link, while B and <left> go back in history.

In addition, the following PAX-specific key bindings are available:

- M-. visits the source location of the definition corresponding
  to the link under the point.

- Invoking mgl-pax-document on a section title link will show the
  documentation of that section on its own page.

- n moves to the next PAX definition on the page.

- p moves to the previous PAX definition on the page.

- u follows the first Up: link (to the first containing
  SECTION) if any.

- U is like u but positions the cursor at the top of the page.

- v visits the source location of the current definition (the one
  under the cursor or the first one above it).

- V visits the source location of the first definition on the
  page.

#### Browsing with Other Browsers

When the value of the Elisp variable mgl-pax-browser-function
is not w3m-browse-url (see Emacs Setup), requests are served via
a web server started in the running Lisp, and documentation is most
likely displayed in a separate browser window.

By default, mgl-pax-browser-function is nil, which makes PAX use
browse-url-browser-function. You may want to customize the related
browse-url-new-window-flag or, for Chrome, set
browse-url-chrome-arguments to ("--new-window").

By default, mgl-pax-web-server-port is nil, and PAX will pick a
free port automatically.

In the browser, clicking on the locative on the left of the
name (e.g. in - [function] PRINT) will raise and focus the Emacs
window (if Emacs is not in text mode, and also subject to window
manager focus stealing settings), then go to the corresponding
source location. For sections, clicking on the lambda link will do
the same (see *DOCUMENT-FANCY-HTML-NAVIGATION*).

Finally, note that the URLs exposed by the web server are subject to
change, and even the port used may vary by session if the Elisp
variable mgl-pax-web-server-port is nil.

- [variable] *BROWSE-HTML-STYLE* :CHARTER

    The HTML style to use for browsing live documentation. Affects only
    non-w3m browsers. See *DOCUMENT-HTML-DEFAULT-STYLE* for the possible
    values.

    If you change this variable, you may need to do a hard refresh in
    the browser (often C-<f5>).

#### Apropos

The Elisp functions mgl-pax-apropos, mgl-pax-apropos-all, and
mgl-pax-apropos-package can display the results of DREF-APROPOS in
the live documentation browser.
These extend the functionality of slime-apropos,
slime-apropos-all and slime-apropos-package to support more
kinds of definitions in an extensible way. The correspondence
is so close that the PAX versions might take over the Slime key
bindings.

Note that apropos functionality is also exposed via the
PAX Live Home Page.

More concretely, the PAX versions supports the following extensions:

- Definitions with string names. One can search for
  ASDF:SYSTEMs, PACKAGEs and
  CLHS sections, glossary entries, format directives,
  reader macro characters, loop keywords.

- Exact or substring matching of the name and the package.

- Matching only symbol or string names.

On the PAX Live Home Page, one may Browse by Locative Types, which
gives access to some of the apropos functionality via the browser
without involving Emacs.

On the result page:

- A DREF-APROPOS form to reproduce the results at the REPL is shown.

- One may toggle the EXTERNAL-ONLY and CASE-SENSITIVE boolean
  arguments.

- One may switch between list, and detailed view. The list view only
  shows the first, bulleted line for each
  definition, while the detailed view includes the full
  documentation of definitions with the exception of SECTIONs.

- The returned references are presented in two groups: those with
  non-symbol and those with symbol names. The non-symbol group is
  sorted by locative type then by name. The symbol group is sorted
  by name then by locative type.

With mgl-pax-apropos-all and mgl-pax-apropos-package being
simple convenience functions on top of mgl-pax-apropos, we only
discuss the latter in detail here. For the others, see the Elisp
docstrings.

##### The STRING Argument of mgl-pax-apropos

The STRING argument consists of a name pattern and a DTYPE.

The name pattern has the following forms.

- :print matches definitions whose names are the string print
  or a symbol with SYMBOL-NAME print. Vertical bar form as in
  :|prInt| is also also supported and is useful in when
  CASE-SENSITIVE is true.

- "print" matches definitions whose names contain print as
  a substring.

- print is like the previous, substring matching case. Use this
  form to save typing if the pattern does not contain spaces and
  does not start with a colon.

- The empty string matches everything.

After the name pattern, STRING may contain a
DTYPE that the definitions must match.

- print t matches definitions with LISP-LOCATIVE-TYPES, which is
  the default (equivalent to print).

- print function matches functions whose names contain
  print (e.g. CL:PRINT and CL:PPRINT).

- :print function is like the previous example but with exact
  name match (so it matches CL:PRINT but not CL:PPRINT).

- print variable matches for example *PRINT-ESCAPE*.

- print (or variable function) matches all variables and functions
  with print in their names.

- array (or type (not class)) matches DEFTYPEs and but not CLASSes
  with the string array in their names.

- &nbsp;pax:section (note the leading space) matches all PAX
  sections (EXTERNAL-ONLY NIL is necessary to see many of them).

- print dref:pseudo matches definitions with PSEUDO-LOCATIVE-TYPES
  such as MGL-PAX:CLHS.

- print dref:top matches definitions with all locative
  types (LOCATIVE-TYPES).

##### The PACKAGE Argument of mgl-pax-apropos

When mgl-pax-apropos is invoked with a prefix argument, it
prompts for a package pattern among other things. The pattern may be
like the following examples.

- :none restricts matches to non-symbol names.

- :any restricts matches to symbol names.

- :cl restricts matches to symbols in the CL package.

- :|X Y| is similar to the previous, but the vertical bar syntax
  allows for spaces in names.

- mgl restricts matches to packages whose name contains mgl as a
  substring.

- "x y" is the same as the previous, but the explicit quotes allow
  for spaces in names.

The above examples assume case-insensitive matching.

#### PAX Live Home Page

When Browsing Live Documentation, the home page provides
quick access to documentation of the definitions in the system. In
Emacs, when mgl-pax-document is invoked with the empty string, it
visits the home page.

The home page may also be accessed directly by going to the root
page of the web server (if one is started). Here, unless the home
page is viewed with w3m, one may directly look
up documentation and access Apropos via the input boxes provided.

- [function] ENSURE-WEB-SERVER &KEY PORT HYPERSPEC-ROOT

    Start or update a web server on PORT for Browsing Live Documentation.
    Returns the base URL of the server (e.g. http://localhost:32790),
    which goes to the PAX Live Home Page. If the web server is running
    already (ENSURE-WEB-SERVER) simply returns its base URL.

    Note that even when using Emacs but Browsing with Other Browsers,
    the web server is started automatically. When Browsing with w3m, no
    web server is involved at all. Calling this function explicitly is
    only needed if the Emacs integration is not used, or to override
    PORT and HYPERSPEC-ROOT.

    - If PORT is NIL or 0, then the server will use any free port.

    - If there is a server already running and PORT is not NIL or 0,
      then the server is restarted on PORT.

    - If HYPERSPEC-ROOT is NIL, the HyperSpec pages will be served from
      any previously provided HYPERSPEC-ROOT or, failing that, from
      *DOCUMENT-HYPERSPEC-ROOT*.

    - If HYPERSPEC-ROOT is non-NIL, then pages in the HyperSpec will be
      served from HYPERSPEC-ROOT. The following command changes the root
      without affecting the server in any other way:

            (ensure-web-server :hyperspec-root "/usr/share/doc/hyperspec/")

##### Top-level PAX Sections

The PAX Live Home Page lists the top-level PAX sections: those
that have no other SECTIONs referencing them (see DEFSECTION).

##### ASDF:SYSTEMs and Related PACKAGEs

The PAX Live Home Page lists all ASDF:SYSTEMs and PACKAGEs in the Lisp.
For easier overview, the they are grouped based on their
SOURCE-LOCATIONs. Two systems are in the same group if the directory
of one (i.e. the directory of the .asd file in which it was
defined) is the same or is below the other's.

A PACKAGE presented under a group of systems, if the SOURCE-LOCATION
of the package is below the the top-most directory among the systems
in the group.

##### Systemless Packages

The PAX Live Home Page lists PACKAGEs
unrelated to any ASDF:SYSTEM
as systemless.

##### Browse by Locative Types

The PAX Live Home Page provides quick links to Apropos result
pages for all Basic Locative Types which may have
definitions.

- [glossary-term] related

    Two definitions are related if the directory of one's
    SOURCE-LOCATIONs contains the directory of the other's.

### Markdown Support

Markdown in docstrings and titles is processed with the 3BMD library.

#### Markdown in Docstrings

- Docstrings can be indented in any of the usual styles. PAX
  normalizes indentation by stripping the longest run of leading
  spaces common to all non-blank lines except the first. Thus, the
  following two docstrings are equivalent:

        (defun foo ()
          "This is
          indented
          differently")
        
        (defun foo ()
          "This is
        indented
        differently")

- When Browsing Live Documentation, the page displayed can be of,
say, a single function within what would constitute the offline
documentation of a library. Because Markdown reference link
definitions, for example

        [Daring Fireball]: http://daringfireball.net/

    can be defined anywhere, they wouldn't be resolvable in that
    case, their use is discouraged. Currently, only reflink
    definitions within the documentation of the same
    definition are guaranteed to be resolvable. This is left
    intentionally vague because the specifics are subject to change.

    See DEFINE-GLOSSARY-TERM for a better alternative to Markdown
    reference links.

Docstrings of definitions which do not have a Home Section and are
not PAX constructs themselves (e.g SECTION, GLOSSARY-TERM, NOTE) are
assumed to have been written with no knowledge of PAX and to conform
to Markdown only by accident. These docstrings are thus sanitized
more aggressively.

- Indentation of what looks like blocks of Lisp code is rounded up to
a multiple of 4. More precisely, non-zero indented lines between
blank lines or the docstring boundaries are reindented if the first
non-space character of the first line is an ( or a ; character.

- Special HTML characters <& are escaped.

- Furthermore, to reduce the chance of inadvertently introducing a
Markdown heading, if a line starts with a string of # characters,
then the first one is automatically escaped. Thus, the following two
docstrings are equivalent:

        The characters #\Space, #\Tab and
        #Return are in the whitespace group.
        
        The characters #\Space, #\Tab and
        \#Return are in the whitespace group.

#### Markdown in Titles

- [glossary-term] title

    A title is a STRING associated with a definition (e.g. with
    the TITLE argument of DEFSECTION or DEFINE-GLOSSARY-TERM). Titles
    are accessible DOCTITLE and processed according to
    Markdown in Titles.

Titles undergo Codification and may be a single paragraph
containing explicit Markdown inline code, Markdown emphasis,
Markdown images, inline MathJax and HTML entities (e.g. &quot;).
Other kinds of Markdown markup and block elements are not allowed.

- [function] DOCTITLE OBJECT

    Return the title of OBJECT if it has one or NIL. For
    Codification, the title is interpreted in the package returned by
    DOCSTRING. DOCTITLE can be extended via DOCTITLE*.

#### Syntax Highlighting

For syntax highlighting, GitHub's fenced code blocks Markdown
extension to mark up code blocks with triple backticks is enabled so
all you need to do is write:

    ```elisp
    (defun foo ())
    ```

to get syntactically marked up HTML output. Copy src/style.css
from PAX and you are set. The language tag, elisp in this example,
is optional and defaults to common-lisp.

See the documentation of 3BMD and Colorize for the details.

#### MathJax

Displaying pretty mathematics between in TeX format is
supported via MathJax.

- Inline

    It can be done inline (within a paragraph):

        Pretty, eh? $\int_0^\infty e^{-x^2} dx=\frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}$ Yes.

    which is displayed as

    Pretty, eh? $\int_0^\infty e^{-x^2} dx=\frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}$ Yes.

    To avoid rendering between $5 and $6 with inline math, both
    the opening and the closing $ character must be followed /
    preceded by a non-space character. This agrees with Pandoc.

    Alternatively, the $`x_0`$ syntax may be used (renders as
    $`x_0`$), which has no restriction on spacing.

- Block

    The $$ is supported as a block element:

        Pretty, eh?
        
        $$\int_0^\infty e^{-x^2} dx=\frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}$$
        
        Yes.

    which will be rendered in its own paragraph:

    Pretty, eh?

    $$\int_0^\infty e^{-x^2} dx=\frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}$$

    Yes.

    $$ is also legal to use inline, but it's not recommended as it
    gets rendered inline on GitHub but as display math in
    PDF Output.

MathJax will leave inline code (e.g. those between single backticks)
and code blocks (triple backtricks) alone. Outside code, use
<span>$</span> to scare MathJax off.

Escaping all those backslashes in TeX fragments embedded in Lisp
strings can be a pain. Pythonic String Reader can help with that.

### Codification

- [variable] *DOCUMENT-UPPERCASE-IS-CODE* T

    When true, interesting names extracted from codifiable words
    marked up as code with backticks. For example, this docstring

        "T PRINT CLASSes SECTION *PACKAGE* MGL-PAX ASDF
        CaMeL Capital"

    is equivalent to this:

        "`T` `PRINT` `CLASS`es `SECTION` `*PACKAGE*` `MGL-PAX` `ASDF`
        CaMel Capital"

    and renders as

    T PRINT CLASSes SECTION MGL-PAX ASDF CaMel Capital

    where the links are added due to *DOCUMENT-LINK-CODE*.

    To suppress codification, add a backslash to the beginning of the
    a codifiable word or right after the leading * if it would
    otherwise be parsed as Markdown emphasis:

        "\\SECTION *\\PACKAGE*"

    The number of backslashes is doubled above because that's how the
    example looks in a docstring. Note that the backslash is discarded
    even if *DOCUMENT-UPPERCASE-IS-CODE* is false.

- [glossary-term] codifiable

    A word is codifiable if

    - it has a single uppercase character (e.g. it's T) and no
      lowercase characters at all, or

    - there is more than one uppercase character and no lowercase
      characters between them (e.g. CLASSes, nonREADable,
      CLASS-NAMEs but not Classes or aTe.

- [glossary-term] interesting

    A name is interesting if

    - it names a symbol external to its package, or

    - it is at least 3 characters long and names an interned symbol, or

    - it names a Local Definition.

    See Package and Readtable.

- [variable] *DOCUMENT-DOWNCASE-UPPERCASE-CODE* NIL

    If true, then all Markdown inline code (e.g. `code`, which
    renders as code) – including Codification – which has no
    lowercase characters is downcased in the output. Characters of
    literal strings in the code may be of any case. If this variable is
    :ONLY-IN-MARKUP and the output format does not support markup (e.g.
    it's :PLAIN), then no downcasing is performed. For example,

        `(PRINT "Hello")`

    is downcased to

        `(print "Hello")`

    because it only contains uppercase characters outside the string.
    However,

        `MiXed "RESULTS"`

    is not altered because it has lowercase characters.

    If the first two characters are backslashes, then no downcasing is
    performed, in addition to Escaping Autolinking. Use this to mark
    inline code that's not Lisp.

        Press `\\M-.` in Emacs.

### Linking

PAX supports linking to definitions either with
explicit Reflinks or with Autolinks.

When generating offline documentation, only the definitions in
DOCUMENTABLE may be linkable, but when
Browsing Live Documentation, everything is linkable as
documentation is generated on-demand.

Many examples in this section link to standard Common Lisp
definitions. In the offline case, these will link to external
URLs, while in the live case to
disambiguation pages that list the definition in the running Lisp
and in the HyperSpec.

Invoking M-. on WORD or NAME in
any of the following examples will disambiguate based on the textual
context, determining the locative. This is because navigation and
linking use the same Parsing algorithm, although linking is a bit
more strict about trimming, depluralization, and it performs
Filtering Links. On the other hand, M-. cannot visit the
CLHS references because there are no associated source
locations.

- [glossary-term] stable printed locative

    The Link Format relies on definitions having a unique
    textual representation that doesn't change. More concretely, if
    PRIN1 under WITH-STANDARD-IO-SYNTAX but with *PRINT-READABLY* NIL
    produces the same unique string deterministically, then linking to
    definitions works even with non-readable locatives. The
    uniqueness condition requires that if two definitions are different
    under XREF=, then their textual representations are also different.

    On the other hand, for example, a method involving an EQL
    specializer with an object printed with PRINT-UNREADABLE-OBJECT
    :IDENTITY T does not produce a stable string and links will break.

#### Reflink

The Markdown reference link syntax [label][id] is
repurposed for linking to definitions. In the following, we
discuss the various forms of reflinks.

##### Specific Reflink

Format: [ WORD ][ LOCATIVE ]

The first name in WORD (with depluralization) that forms a valid
DREF with LOCATIVE is determined, and that definition is
linked to. If there is no such DREF, then an UNRESOLVABLE-REFLINK
warning is signalled.

Examples:

- [`EQL`][type] renders as EQL.

- [EQL][type] renders as EQL.

The Markdown link definition (i.e. type above) needs no backticks
to mark it as code, but here and below, the second example relies on
*DOCUMENT-UPPERCASE-IS-CODE* being true.

##### Specific Reflink with Text

Format: [LINK TEXT][ NAME LOCATIVE ]

If NAME and LOCATIVE form a valid DREF, then that
definition is linked to with link text LINK TEXT. If there is no
such DREF, then an UNRESOLVABLE-REFLINK warning is signalled.

In this form, if NAME starts with #\", then it's read as a string,
else as a symbol.

Examples:

- [see this][eql type] renders as see this.

- [see this]["MGL-PAX" package] renders as see this.

##### Unspecific Reflink

Format: [ WORD ][]

The first name in WORD (with depluralization, symbols only) that
has some DEFINITIONS is determined, and those definitions are linked
to. If no name with any definition is found, then an
UNRESOLVABLE-REFLINK warning is signalled.

Examples:

- single link: [PRINT][] renders as PRINT.

- multiple links: [EQL][] renders as EQL.

- no definitions: [BAD-NAME][] renders as BAD-NAME.

##### Unspecific Reflink with Text

Format: [LINK TEXT][ NAME ]

The DEFINITIONS of NAME are determined, and those definitions are
linked to. If NAME has no definitions, then an UNRESOLVABLE-REFLINK
warning is signalled.

In this form, if NAME starts with #\", then it's read as a string,
else as as symbol.

Examples:

- [see this][print] renders as see this.

- [see this][eql] renders as see this.

##### Markdown Reflink

Format: [label][id]

This is a normal Markdown reference link if id is not a valid locative.

- [see this][user-defined] renders unchanged.

        (dref:dref 'user-defined 'locative)
        .. debugger invoked on LOCATE-ERROR:
        ..   Could not locate USER-DEFINED LOCATIVE.
        ..   USER-DEFINED is not a valid locative type or locative alias.

        (document "[see this][user-defined]" :format :markdown)
        .. [see this][user-defined]
        ..

Use URLs with DEFINE-GLOSSARY-TERM as a better alternative to
Markdown reference links (see Markdown in Docstrings).

##### Unresolvable Links

- [condition] UNRESOLVABLE-REFLINK WARNING

    When DOCUMENT encounters a Reflink that looks
    like a PAX construct but has no matching definition, it signals an
    UNRESOLVABLE-REFLINK warning.

    - If the OUTPUT-REFLINK restart is invoked, then no warning is
      printed and the Markdown link is left unchanged. MUFFLE-WARNING is
      equivalent to OUTPUT-REFLINK.

    - If the OUTPUT-LABEL restart is invoked, then no warning is printed
      and the Markdown link is replaced by its label. For example,
      [NONEXISTENT][function] becomes NONEXISTENT.

    - If the warning is not handled, then it is printed to
      *ERROR-OUTPUT*, and it behaves as if OUTPUT-LABEL was invoked.

- [function] OUTPUT-REFLINK &OPTIONAL CONDITION

    Invoke the OUTPUT-REFLINK restart. See UNRESOLVABLE-REFLINK.

- [function] OUTPUT-LABEL &OPTIONAL CONDITION

    Invoke the OUTPUT-LABEL restart. See UNRESOLVABLE-REFLINK.

#### Autolink

Markdown inline code automatically links to the corresponding
definitions without having to use Reflinks. This works especially
well in conjunction with Codification. The following examples
assume that *DOCUMENT-UPPERCASE-IS-CODE* is true. If that's not the
case, explicit backticks are required on WORD (but not on
LOCATIVE).

##### Specific Autolink

Format: WORD LOCATIVE or
LOCATIVE WORD

The first name in WORD (with depluralization) that forms a valid
DREF with LOCATIVE is determined, and that definition is
linked to. If no such name is found, then Unspecific Autolink is
attempted.

Examples:

- PRINT function renders as PRINT function.

- type EQL renders as type EQL.

- type EQL function renders as type EQL function.

If LOCATIVE has spaces, then it needs to be marked up as code, too.
For example,

    DREF-NAME `(reader dref)`

renders as DREF-NAME (reader dref).

##### Unspecific Autolink

Format: WORD

The first name in WORD (with depluralization, symbols only) that
has some DEFINITIONS is determined, and those definitions are linked
to. If no such name is found or the autolink to this name is
suppressed (see below), then WORD is left unchanged. If a locative
is found before or after WORD, then Specific Autolink is tried
first.

Examples:

- PRINT renders as PRINT.

- EQL renders as EQL.

Unspecific Autolinking is suppressed if the name found has a
Local Definition or was linked to before in the same docstring:

- "My other CAR is also a CAR" renders as "My other CAR is also a
  CAR".

- "[COS][] and COS" renders as "COS and COS".

- "[EQL][type] and EQL" renders as "EQL and EQL".

- "EQ and the EQ function" renders as "EQ and the EQ function".

Unspecific Autolinking to T and NIL is also suppressed (see
*DOCUMENT-LINK-TO-HYPERSPEC*):

- "T and NIL" renders as "T and NIL".

As an exception, a single link (be it either a Specific Link or an
unambiguous Unspecific Link) to a SECTION or GLOSSARY-TERM is not
suppressed to allow their titles to be displayed properly:

- "@NAME and @NAME" renders as "name and name".

##### Escaping Autolinking

In the common case, when *DOCUMENT-UPPERCASE-IS-CODE* is true,
prefixing an uppercase word with a backslash prevents it from being
codified and thus also prevents Autolinking form kicking in. For
example,

    \DOCUMENT

renders as DOCUMENT. If it should be marked up as code but not
autolinked, the backslash must be within backticks like this:

    `\DOCUMENT`

This renders as DOCUMENT. Alternatively, the
DISLOCATED or the ARGUMENT locative may be used as in
[DOCUMENT][dislocated].

#### Linking to the HyperSpec

- [variable] *DOCUMENT-LINK-TO-HYPERSPEC* T

    If true, consider definitions found in the Common Lisp HyperSpec
    for linking. For example,

    - PRINT renders as PRINT.

    In offline documentation, this would be a link to the hyperspec
    unless #'PRINT in the running Lisp is DOCUMENTABLE.

    When Browsing Live Documentation, everything is linkable, so the
    generated link will go to a disambiguation page that lists the
    definition in the Lisp and in the HyperSpec.

    Locatives work as expected (see *DOCUMENT-LINK-CODE*): FIND-IF
    links to FIND-IF, FUNCTION links to FUNCTION, and
    [FUNCTION][type] links to FUNCTION.

    Unspecific Autolinking to T and NIL is suppressed. If desired, use
    Reflinks such as [T][] (that links to T) or
    [T][constant] (that links to T).

    Note that linking explicitly with the CLHS locative is not subject
    to the value of this variable.

- [variable] *DOCUMENT-HYPERSPEC-ROOT* "http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/"

    A URL of the Common Lisp HyperSpec.
    The default value is the canonical location. When invoked from
    Emacs, the Elisp variable
    common-lisp-hyperspec-root is in effect.

#### Linking to Sections

The following variables control how to generate section numbering,
table of contents and navigation links.

- [variable] *DOCUMENT-LINK-SECTIONS* T

    When true, HTML anchors and PDF destinations are generated before
    the headings (e.g. of sections), which allows the table of contents
    to contain links and also code-like references to sections (like
    @FOO-MANUAL) to be translated to links with the
    TITLE being the link text.

- [variable] *DOCUMENT-MAX-NUMBERING-LEVEL* 3

    A non-negative integer. In their hierarchy, sections on levels less
    than this value get numbered in the format of 3.1.2. Setting it to
    0 turns numbering off.

- [variable] *DOCUMENT-MAX-TABLE-OF-CONTENTS-LEVEL* 3

    An integer that determines the depth of the table of contents.

    - If negative, then no table of contents is generated.

    - If non-negative, and there are multiple top-level sections on a
      page, then they are listed at the top of the page.

    - If positive, then for each top-level section a table of contents
      is printed after its heading, which includes a nested tree of
      section titles whose depth is limited by this value.

    If *DOCUMENT-LINK-SECTIONS* is true, then the tables will link to
    the sections.

- [variable] *DOCUMENT-TEXT-NAVIGATION* NIL

    If true, then before each heading a line is printed with links to
    the previous, parent and next section. Needs
    *DOCUMENT-LINK-SECTIONS* to be on to work.

- [variable] *DOCUMENT-FANCY-HTML-NAVIGATION* T

    If true and the output format is HTML, then headings get a
    navigation component that consists of links to the previous, parent,
    next section, a self-link, and a link to the definition in the
    source code if available (see :SOURCE-URI-FN in DOCUMENT). This
    component is normally hidden, it is visible only when the mouse is
    over the heading. Has no effect if *DOCUMENT-LINK-SECTIONS* is
    false.

#### Filtering Links

- [variable] *DOCUMENT-LINK-CODE* T

    Whether definitions of things other than SECTIONs
    are allowed to be linkable.

- [glossary-term] linkable

    When a reference is encountered to definition D
    while processing documentation for some page C, we say that
    definition D is linkable (from C) if

    - D denotes a SECTION and *DOCUMENT-LINK-SECTIONS* is true, or

    - D does not denote a SECTION and *DOCUMENT-LINK-CODE* is true

    ... and

    - We are Browsing Live Documentation, or

    - D is an external definition (CLHS or denotes a
      GLOSSARY-TERM with a URL), or

    - D's page is C, or

    - D's page is relativizable to C.

    In the above, D's page is the last of the pages in the
    DOCUMENTABLE to which D's documentation is written (see :OBJECTS in
    PAGES), and we say that a page is relativizable to another if it
    is possible to construct a relative link between their
    :URI-FRAGMENTs.

##### Specific Link

Specific links are those Reflinks and Autolinks that have a
single locative and therefore at most a single matching
definition. These are Specific Reflink,
Specific Reflink with Text and Specific Autolink.

A specific link to a linkable definition produces a link in the
output. If the definition is not linkable, then the output will
contain only what would otherwise be the link text.

##### Unspecific Link

Unspecific links are those Reflinks and Autolinks that do not
specify a locative and match all definitions
with a name. These are Unspecific Reflink,
Unspecific Reflink with Text and Unspecific Autolink.

To make the links predictable and manageable in number, the
following steps are taken.

1. Definitions that are not symbol-based (i.e. whose DREF-NAME
is not a symbol) are filtered out to prevent unrelated
PACKAGEs, ASDF:SYSTEMs and CLHS
sections from cluttering the documentation without the control
provided by importing symbols.

2. All references with LOCATIVE-TYPE LOCATIVE are filtered out.

3. Non-linkable definitions are removed.

4. If the definitions include a GENERIC-FUNCTION, then
all definitions with LOCATIVE-TYPE METHOD,
ACCESSOR, READER and WRITER are
removed to avoid linking to a possibly large number of methods.

If at most a single definition remains, then the output is the same
as with a Specific Link. If multiple definitions remain, then the
link text is output followed by a number of numbered links, one to
each definition.

#### Link Format

The following variables control various aspects of links and URLs.

- [variable] *DOCUMENT-URL-VERSIONS* (2 1)

    A list of versions of PAX URL formats to support in the
    generated documentation. The first in the list is used to generate
    links.

    PAX emits HTML anchors before the documentation of SECTIONs
    (see Linking to Sections) and other things (see Linking). For the
    function FOO, in the current version (version 2), the anchor is
    <a id="MGL-PAX:FOO%20FUNCTION">, and its URL will end
    with #MGL-PAX:FOO%20FUNCTION.

    Note that to make the URL independent of whether a symbol is
    internal or external to their SYMBOL-PACKAGE, single
    colon is printed where a double colon would be expected. Package and
    symbol names are both printed verbatim except for escaping colons
    and spaces with a backslash. For exported symbols with no funny
    characters, this coincides with how PRIN1 would print the symbol,
    while having the benefit of making the URL independent of the Lisp
    printer's escaping strategy and producing human-readable output for
    mixed-case symbols. No such promises are made for non-ASCII
    characters, and their URLs may change in future versions. Locatives
    are printed with PRIN1.

    Version 1 is based on the more strict HTML4 standard and the id of
    FOO is "x-28MGL-PAX-3A-3AFOO-20FUNCTION-29". This is supported
    by GitHub-flavoured Markdown. Version 2 has minimal clutter and is
    obviously preferred. However, in order not to break external links,
    by default, both anchors are generated.

    Let's understand the generated Markdown.

        (defun foo (x))
        
        (document #'foo :format :markdown)
        => ("<a id=\"x-28MGL-PAX-3AFOO-20FUNCTION-29\"></a>
        <a id=\"MGL-PAX:FOO%20FUNCTION\"></a>
        
        - [function] **FOO** *X*
        ")
        
        (let ((*document-url-versions* '(1)))
          (document #'foo :format :markdown))
        => ("<a id=\"x-28MGL-PAX-3AFOO-20FUNCTION-29\"></a>
        
        - [function] **FOO** *X*
        ")

- [variable] *DOCUMENT-MIN-LINK-HASH-LENGTH* 4

    Recall that Markdown reference links (like [label][id]) are used for
    Linking. It is desirable to have ids that are short to maintain
    legibility of the generated Markdown, but also stable to reduce the
    spurious diffs in the generated documentation, which can be a pain
    in a version control system.

    Clearly, there is a tradeoff here. This variable controls how many
    characters of the MD5 sum of the full link id (the reference as a
    string) are retained. If collisions are found due to the low number
    of characters, then the length of the hash of the colliding
    reference is increased.

    This variable has no effect on the HTML generated from Markdown, but
    it can make Markdown output more readable.

- [variable] *DOCUMENT-BASE-URL* NIL

    When *DOCUMENT-BASE-URL* is non-NIL, this is prepended to all
    Markdown relative URLs. It must be a valid URL without no query and
    fragment parts (that is, http://lisp.org/doc/ but not
    http://lisp.org/doc?a=1 or http://lisp.org/doc#fragment). Note
    that intra-page links using only URL fragments (e.g. and explicit
    HTML links (e.g. <a href="...">) in Markdown are not
    affected.

### Local Definition

While documentation is generated for a definition, that
definition is considered local. Other local definitions may also be
established. Local definitions inform Codification through
interesting names and affect Unspecific Autolinking.

    (defun foo (x)
      "FOO adds one to X."
      (1+ x)

In this example, while the docstring of FOO is being processed, the
global definition (DREF 'FOO 'FUNCTION) is also considered local,
which suppresses linking FOO in the FOO's docstring back to its
definition. If FOO has other definitions, Unspecific Autolinking to
those is also suppressed.

Furthermore, the purely local definition (DREF 'X 'ARGUMENT) is
established, causing the argument name X to be
codified because X is now interesting.

See DOCUMENTING-DEFINITION and WITH-DISLOCATED-NAMES in
Extending DOCUMENT.

### Overview of Escaping

Let's recap how escaping Codification,
downcasing, and Linking
works.

- One backslash in front of a word turns codification off. Use this
  to prevent codification words such as DOCUMENT, which is all
  uppercase hence codifiable, and it names an exported symbol hence
  it is interesting.

- One backslash right after an opening backtick turns autolinking
  off.

- Two backslashes right after an opening backtick turns autolinking
  and downcasing off. Use this for things that are not Lisp code but
  which need to be in a monospace font.

In the following examples capital C/D/A letters mark the presence,
and a/b/c the absence of codification, downcasing, and autolinking
assuming all these features are enabled by
*DOCUMENT-UPPERCASE-IS-CODE*, *DOCUMENT-DOWNCASE-UPPERCASE-CODE*,
and *DOCUMENT-LINK-CODE*.

    DOCUMENT                => [`document`][1234]    (CDA)
    \DOCUMENT               => DOCUMENT              (cda)
    `\DOCUMENT`             => `document`            (CDa)
    `\\DOCUMENT`            => `DOCUMENT`            (CdA)
    [DOCUMENT][]            => [`document`][1234]    (CDA)
    [\DOCUMENT][]           => [DOCUMENT][1234]      (cdA)
    [`\DOCUMENT`][]         => [`document`][1234]    (CDA) *
    [`\\DOCUMENT`][]        => [`DOCUMENT`][1234]    (CdA)
    [DOCUMENT][dislocated]  => `document`            (CDa)

Note that in the example marked with *, the single backslash,
that would normally turn autolinking off, is ignored because it is
in an explicit link.

### Output Formats

- [variable] *DOCUMENT-MARK-UP-SIGNATURES* T

    When true, some things such as function names and arglists are
    rendered as bold and italic. In HTML Output and PDF Output,
    locative types become links to sources (if :SOURCE-URI-FN is
    provided, see PAGES), and the symbol becomes a self-link for your
    permalinking pleasure.

    For example, a reference is rendered in Markdown roughly as:

        - [function] foo x y

    With this option on, the above becomes:

        - [function] **foo** *x y*

    Also, in HTML **foo** will be a link to that very entry and
    [function] may turn into a link to sources.

#### Plain Output

This is the default :FORMAT of DOCUMENT, intended to be a
replacement for CL:DOCUMENTATION. :PLAIN (short for plain text) is
very similar to :MARKDOWN, but most of the markup that would make
reading in, say, the REPL unpleasant is removed.

- Markup for Markdown emphasis, Markdown inline code,
  Markdown reference links and fenced code blocks is stripped from
  the output.

- No link anchors are emitted.

- No section numbering.

- No table of contents.

#### Markdown Output

By default, DREFs are documented in the following format.

    - [<locative-type>] <name> <arglist>
    
        <docstring>

The line with the bullet is printed with DOCUMENTING-DEFINITION. The
docstring is processed with DOCUMENT-DOCSTRING while
Local Definitions established with WITH-DISLOCATED-NAMES are in
effect for all variables locally bound in a definition with ARGLIST,
and *PACKAGE* is bound to the second return value of DOCSTRING.

With this default format, PAX supports all locative types, but for
some Basic Locative Types defined in DRef and the
PAX Locatives, special provisions have been made.

- For definitions with a VARIABLE or CONSTANT locative,
their initform is printed as their arglist. The initform is the
INITFORM argument of the locative if provided, or the global symbol
value of their name. If no INITFORM is provided, and the symbol is
globally unbound, then no arglist is printed.

When the printed initform is too long, it is truncated.

- Depending of what the SETF locative refers to, the ARGLIST of the
setf expander, setf function, or the method
signature is printed as with the METHOD locative.

- For definitions with a METHOD locative, the arglist printed is
the method signature, which consists of the locative's QUALIFIERS
and SPECIALIZERS appended.

- For definitions with an ACCESSOR, READER or
WRITER locative, the class on which they are specialized is printed
as their arglist.

- For definitions with a STRUCTURE-ACCESSOR locative, the arglist
printed is the locative's CLASS-NAME argument if provided.

- For definitions with a CLASS locative, the arglist printed is the
list of public superclasses with STANDARD-OBJECT and CONDITION
omitted.

- For definitions with a STRUCTURE locative, the arglist printed is
the list of public superclasses with STRUCTURE-OBJECT omitted.

- For definitions with a CONDITION locative, the arglist printed is
the list of public superclasses with STANDARD-OBJECT and
CONDITION omitted.

- For definitions with a ASDF:SYSTEM locative, their most
important slots are printed as an unnumbered list.

- For definitions with the LOCATIVE locative type, their
LOCATIVE-TYPE-DIRECT-SUPERS and LOCATIVE-TYPE-DIRECT-SUBS are
printed.

- When documentation is being generated for a definition with
the SECTION locative, a new (sub)section is opened (see
WITH-HEADING), within which documentation for its each of its
SECTION-ENTRIES is generated. A fresh line is printed after all
entries except the last.

- For definitions with a GLOSSARY-TERM locative, no arglist is
printed, and if non-NIL, GLOSSARY-TERM-TITLE is printed as name.

- For definitions with a GO locative, its LOCATIVE-ARGS are printed
as its arglist, along with a redirection message.

- See the INCLUDE locative.

- For definitions with a CLHS locative, the LOCATIVE-ARGS are printed
as the arglist. For CLHS SECTIONs, the title is included in the
arglist.

- For definitions with an UNKNOWN locative, the LOCATIVE-ARGS are
printed as the arglist. There is no docstring.

- [glossary-term] public superclasses

    The public superclasses of a class are tightest envelope of
    superclasses with names exported from some package. This envelope is
    constructed by recursing depth-first into the superclass hierarchy.
    If the name of the superclass currently processed is exported from
    any package, then it is collected as a public superclass, and we do
    not recurse into its superclasses.

#### PDF Output

When invoked with :FORMAT :PDF, DOCUMENT generates
Markdown Output and converts it to PDF with Pandoc, which in turn
uses [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/). Make sure that they
are installed.

    (with-open-file (s "x.pdf" :direction :output :if-exists :supersede
                               :if-does-not-exist :create)
      (pax:document "Hello, World!" :stream s :format :pdf))

To see how the output looks like, visit
pax-manual-v0.4.1.pdf and
dref-manual-v0.4.1.pdf.

[pax-manual-sample]: http://quotenil.com/blog-files/pax-manual-v0.4.1.pdf

[dref-manual-sample]: http://quotenil.com/blog-files/dref-manual-v0.4.1.pdf

PDF output is similar to *DOCUMENT-HTML-DEFAULT-STYLE* :CHARTER
without the off-white tint and with coloured instead of underlined
links. The latter is because underlining interferes with hyphenation
in LaTeX. As in HTML output, locative types link to the respective
definition in the sources on GitHub (see MAKE-GIT-SOURCE-URI-FN).

Note that linking from one PDF to another is currently not supported
due to the lack of consistent support in PDF viewers. Therefore,
such links are replaced by their label or the title if any (e.g. of
a SECTION or GLOSSARY-TERM).

The generation of Markdown is subject to the standard
variables (again see DOCUMENT). The Markdown to PDF conversion
can be customized with the following variables.

- [variable] *DOCUMENT-PANDOC-PROGRAM* "pandoc"

    The name of the Pandoc binary. It need not be an absolute pathname
    as PATH is searched.

- [variable] *DOCUMENT-PANDOC-PDF-OPTIONS* (("-V" "papersize=a4") ("-V" "margin-left=1.03in") ("-V" "margin-right=1.03in")
 ("-V" "margin-top=1.435in") ("-V" "margin-bottom=1.435in")
 ("-V" "fontfamily=XCharter") ("-V" "fontsize=11pt") ("-V" "colorlinks=true")
 ("-V" "linkcolor=blue") ("-V" "urlcolor=Maroon") ("-V" "toccolor=blue")
 "--verbose")

    The command-line options to invoke *DOCUMENT-PANDOC-PROGRAM* with.
    For ease of manipulation, related options are grouped into sublists,
    but the entire nested list is flattened to get the list of options
    to pass to Pandoc. If --verbose is specified, then in addition to
    Pandoc logging LaTeX sources, PAX will log to *ERROR-OUTPUT* the
    Markdown that it converts to PDF via LaTeX. The Markdown includes
    *DOCUMENT-PANDOC-PDF-HEADER-INCLUDES* and
    *DOCUMENT-PANDOC-PDF-METADATA-BLOCK*.

- [variable] *DOCUMENT-PANDOC-PDF-HEADER-INCLUDES* "<too messy to include>"

    LaTeX code (a string) to include in the preamble via
    [header-includes](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#layout).

    The default includes have no configuration knobs. Look at the value
    to see how to customize it.

- [variable] *DOCUMENT-PANDOC-PDF-METADATA-BLOCK* ""

    A Pandoc YAML metadata block as a string.

    Concatenate to this string to customize it.

#### Dummy Output

When the FORMAT argument of DOCUMENT is NIL, no output is
generated, but Transcript Consistency Checking is still performed.
Use this feature to quickly test documentation examples.

For example, in Try the test would look
like this:

    (try:signals-not (transcription-consistency-error)
      (document ... :format nil))

### Documentation Generation Implementation Notes

Documentation Generation is supported on ABCL, AllegroCL, CLISP,
CCL, CMUCL, ECL and SBCL, but their outputs may differ due to the
lack of some introspective capability. SBCL generates complete
output. see ARGLIST, DOCSTRING and SOURCE-LOCATION for
implementation notes.

In addition, CLISP does not support the ambiguous case of
Browsing Live Documentation because the current implementation
relies on Swank to list definitions of symbols (as
VARIABLE, FUNCTION, etc), and that simply
doesn't work.

### Utilities for Generating Documentation

Two convenience functions are provided to serve the common case of
having an ASDF system with some readmes and a directory with for the
HTML documentation and the default CSS stylesheet.

- [function] UPDATE-ASDF-SYSTEM-READMES OBJECT ASDF-SYSTEM &KEY (URL-VERSIONS '(1)) (FORMATS '(:MARKDOWN))

    Convenience function to generate up to two readme files in the
    directory holding the ASDF-SYSTEM definition. OBJECT is passed on to
    DOCUMENT.

    If :MARKDOWN is in FORMATS, then README.md is generated with
    anchors, links, inline code, and other markup added. Not necessarily
    the easiest on the eye in an editor but looks good on GitHub.

    If :PLAIN is in FORMATS, then README is generated, which is
    optimized for reading in text format. It has less cluttery markup
    and no Autolinking.

    Example usage:

        (update-asdf-system-readmes @pax-manual :mgl-pax
                                    :formats '(:markdown :plain))

    Note that *DOCUMENT-URL-VERSIONS* is bound to URL-VERSIONS, which
    defaults to using the uglier, version 1 style of URL for the sake of
    GitHub.

#### HTML Output

- [function] UPDATE-ASDF-SYSTEM-HTML-DOCS SECTIONS ASDF-SYSTEM &KEY PAGES (TARGET-DIR (ASDF/SYSTEM:SYSTEM-RELATIVE-PATHNAME ASDF-SYSTEM "doc/")) (UPDATE-CSS-P T) (STYLE *DOCUMENT-HTML-DEFAULT-STYLE*)

    Generate pretty HTML documentation for a single ASDF system,
    possibly linking to GitHub. If UPDATE-CSS-P, copy the STYLE files to
    TARGET-DIR (see *DOCUMENT-HTML-DEFAULT-STYLE*).

    Example usage:

        (update-asdf-system-html-docs @pax-manual :mgl-pax)

    The same, linking to the sources on GitHub:

        (update-asdf-system-html-docs
          @pax-manual :mgl-pax
          :pages
          `((:objects (,mgl-pax::@pax-manual)
             :source-uri-fn ,(make-git-source-uri-fn
                              :mgl-pax
                              "https://github.com/melisgl/mgl-pax"))))

See the following variables, which control HTML generation.

- [variable] *DOCUMENT-HTML-DEFAULT-STYLE* :DEFAULT

    The HTML style to use. It's either STYLE is either :DEFAULT or
    :CHARTER. The :DEFAULT CSS stylesheet relies on the default
    fonts (sans-serif, serif, monospace), while :CHARTER bundles some
    fonts for a more controlled look.

    The value of this variable affects the default style of
    UPDATE-ASDF-SYSTEM-HTML-DOCS.

- [variable] *DOCUMENT-HTML-MAX-NAVIGATION-TABLE-OF-CONTENTS-LEVEL* NIL

    NIL or a non-negative integer. If non-NIL, it overrides
    *DOCUMENT-MAX-NUMBERING-LEVEL* in the dynamic HTML table of contents
    on the left of the page.

- [variable] *DOCUMENT-HTML-LANG* "en"

    The value for the html element's xml:lang and lang
    attributes in the generated HTML.

- [variable] *DOCUMENT-HTML-CHARSET* "UTF-8"

    The value for charset attribute of the <meta http-equiv='Content-Type'
    content='text/html'> element in the generated HTML.

- [variable] *DOCUMENT-HTML-HEAD* NIL

    Stuff to be included in the <head> of the generated HTML.

    - If NIL, nothing is included.

    - If a STRING, then it is written to the HTML output as is without
      any escaping.

    - If a function designator, then it is called with a single
      argument, the HTML stream, where it must write the output.

- [variable] *DOCUMENT-HTML-SIDEBAR* NIL

    Stuff to be included in the HTML sidebar.

    - If NIL, a default sidebar is generated, with
      *DOCUMENT-HTML-TOP-BLOCKS-OF-LINKS*, followed by the dynamic table
      of contents, and *DOCUMENT-HTML-BOTTOM-BLOCKS-OF-LINKS*.

    - If a STRING, then it is written to the HTML output as is without
      any escaping.

    - If a function designator, then it is called with a single
      argument, the HTML stream, where it must write the output.

- [variable] *DOCUMENT-HTML-TOP-BLOCKS-OF-LINKS* NIL

    A list of blocks of links to be displayed on the sidebar on the left,
    above the table of contents. A block is of the form (&KEY TITLE ID
    LINKS), where TITLE will be displayed at the top of the block in a
    HTML DIV with ID followed by the links. LINKS is a list of (URI
    LABEL) elements, where URI maybe a string or an object being
    DOCUMENTed or a REFERENCE thereof.

- [variable] *DOCUMENT-HTML-BOTTOM-BLOCKS-OF-LINKS* NIL

    Like *DOCUMENT-HTML-TOP-BLOCKS-OF-LINKS*, only it is displayed
    below the table of contents.

#### GitHub Workflow

It is generally recommended to commit generated readmes (see
UPDATE-ASDF-SYSTEM-READMES), so that users have something to read
without reading the code and sites like GitHub can display them.

HTML documentation can also be committed, but there is an issue with
that: when linking to the sources (see MAKE-GIT-SOURCE-URI-FN), the
commit id is in the link. This means that code changes need to be
committed first, and only then can HTML documentation be regenerated
and committed in a followup commit.

The second issue is that GitHub is not very good at serving HTML
files from the repository itself (and
[http://htmlpreview.github.io](http://htmlpreview.github.io) chokes
on links to the sources).

The recommended workflow is to use
[gh-pages](https://pages.github.com/), which can be made relatively
painless with the git worktree command. The gist of it is to make
the doc/ directory a checkout of the branch named gh-pages.
There is a [good
description](http://sangsoonam.github.io/2019/02/08/using-git-worktree-to-deploy-github-pages.html)
of this general process. Two commits are needed still, but it is
somewhat less painful.

This way the HTML documentation will be available at

    http://<username>.github.io/<repo-name>

It is probably a good idea to add sections like the
Links and Systems section to allow jumping between the repository
and the gh-pages site.

- [function] MAKE-GITHUB-SOURCE-URI-FN ASDF-SYSTEM GITHUB-URI &KEY GIT-VERSION

    This function is a backward-compatibility wrapper around
    MAKE-GIT-SOURCE-URI-FN, which supersedes MAKE-GITHUB-SOURCE-URI-FN.
    All arguments are passed on to MAKE-GIT-SOURCE-URI-FN, leaving
    URI-FORMAT-STRING at its default, which is suitable for GitHub.

- [function] MAKE-GIT-SOURCE-URI-FN ASDF-SYSTEM GIT-FORGE-URI &KEY GIT-VERSION (URI-FORMAT-STRING "~A/blob/~A/~A#L~S")

    Return an object suitable as :SOURCE-URI-FN of a page spec (see
    the PAGES argument of DOCUMENT). The function looks at the source
    location of the object passed to it, and if the location is found,
    the path is made relative to the top-level directory of the git
    checkout containing the file of the ASDF-SYSTEM and finally an URI
    pointing to your git forge (such as GitHub) is returned. A warning
    is signalled whenever the source location lookup fails or if the
    source location points to a directory not below the directory of
    ASDF-SYSTEM.

    If GIT-FORGE-URI is "https://github.com/melisgl/mgl-pax/" and
    GIT-VERSION is "master", then the returned URI may look like this:

        https://github.com/melisgl/mgl-pax/blob/master/src/pax-early.lisp#L12

    If GIT-VERSION is NIL, then an attempt is made to determine to
    current commit id from the .git in the directory holding
    ASDF-SYSTEM. If no .git directory is found, then no links to
    the git forge will be generated.

    URI-FORMAT-STRING is a CL:FORMAT control string for four arguments:

    - GIT-FORGE-URI,

    - GIT-VERSION,

    - the relative path to the file of the source location of the reference,

    - and the line number.

    The default value of URI-FORMAT-STRING is for GitHub. If using a
    non-standard git forge, such as Sourcehut or GitLab, simply pass a
    suitable URI-FORMAT-STRING matching the URI scheme of your forge.

#### PAX World

PAX World is a registry of documents, which can generate
cross-linked HTML documentation pages for all the registered
documents. There is an official [PAX
World](https://melisgl.github.io/mgl-pax-world/).

- [function] REGISTER-DOC-IN-PAX-WORLD NAME SECTIONS PAGE-SPECS

    Register SECTIONS and PAGE-SPECS under NAME (a symbol) in PAX
    World. By default, UPDATE-PAX-WORLD generates documentation for all
    of these. SECTIONS and PAGE-SPECS must be lists of SECTIONs and
    PAGE-SPECs (SEE DOCUMENT) or designators of function of no arguments
    that return such lists.

For example, this is how PAX registers itself:

    (defun pax-sections ()
      (list @pax-manual))
    
    (defun pax-pages ()
      `((:objects ,(pax-sections)
         :source-uri-fn ,(make-git-source-uri-fn
                          :mgl-pax
                          "https://github.com/melisgl/mgl-pax"))))
    
    (register-doc-in-pax-world :pax 'pax-sections 'pax-pages)

- [function] UPDATE-PAX-WORLD &KEY (DOCS *REGISTERED-PAX-WORLD-DOCS*) DIR UPDATE-CSS-P (STYLE *DOCUMENT-HTML-DEFAULT-STYLE*)

    Generate HTML documentation for all DOCS. Files are created in
    DIR ((asdf:system-relative-pathname :mgl-pax "world/") by
    default if DIR is NIL). DOCS is a list of entries of the form (NAME
    SECTIONS PAGE-SPECS). The default for DOCS is all the sections and
    pages registered with REGISTER-DOC-IN-PAX-WORLD.

    In the absence of :HEADER-FN :FOOTER-FN, :OUTPUT, every spec in
    PAGE-SPECS is augmented with HTML headers, footers and output
    location specifications (based on the name of the section).

    If necessary a default page spec is created for every section.

## Transcripts

What are transcripts for? When writing a tutorial, one often wants
to include a REPL session with maybe a few defuns and a couple of
forms whose output or return values are shown. Also, in a function's
docstring an example call with concrete arguments and return values
speaks volumes. A transcript is a text that looks like a REPL
session, but which has a light markup for printed output and return
values, while no markup (i.e. prompt) for Lisp forms. PAX
transcripts may include output and return values of all forms, or
only selected ones. In either case, the transcript itself can be
easily generated from the source code.

The main worry associated with including examples in the
documentation is that they tend to get out-of-sync with the code.
This is solved by being able to parse back and update transcripts.
In fact, this is exactly what happens during documentation
generation with PAX. Code sections tagged with cl-transcript are
retranscribed and checked for consistency (that is, no difference in
output or return values). If the consistency check fails, an error
is signalled that includes a reference to the object being
documented.

Going beyond documentation, transcript consistency checks can be
used for writing simple tests in a very readable form. For example:

    (+ 1 2)
    => 3
    
    (values (princ :hello) (list 1 2))
    .. HELLO
    => :HELLO
    => (1 2)

All in all, transcripts are a handy tool especially when combined
with the Emacs support to regenerate them and with
PYTHONIC-STRING-READER's triple-quoted strings, that
allow one to work with nested strings with less noise. The
triple-quote syntax can be enabled with:

    (in-readtable pythonic-string-syntax)

### Transcribing with Emacs

Typical transcript usage from within Emacs is simple: add a Lisp
form to a docstring or comment at any indentation level. Move the
cursor right after the end of the form as if you were to evaluate it
with C-x C-e. The cursor is marked by #\^:

    This is part of a docstring.
    
    ```cl-transcript
    (values (princ :hello) (list 1 2))^
    ```

Note that the use of fenced code blocks with the language tag
cl-transcript is only to tell PAX to perform consistency checks at
documentation generation time.

Now invoke the Elisp function mgl-pax-transcribe where the cursor
is, and the fenced code block from the docstring becomes:

    (values (princ :hello) (list 1 2))
    .. HELLO
    => :HELLO
    => (1 2)
    ^

Then you change the printed message and add a comment to the second
return value:

    (values (princ :hello-world) (list 1 2))
    .. HELLO
    => :HELLO
    => (1
        ;; This value is arbitrary.
        2)

When generating the documentation you get a
TRANSCRIPTION-CONSISTENCY-ERROR because the printed output and the
first return value changed, so you regenerate the documentation by
marking the region bounded by #\| and the cursor at #\^ in the
example:

    |(values (princ :hello-world) (list 1 2))
    .. HELLO
    => :HELLO
    => (1
        ;; This value is arbitrary.
        2)
    ^

then invoke the Elisp function mgl-pax-retranscribe-region to get:

    (values (princ :hello-world) (list 1 2))
    .. HELLO-WORLD
    => :HELLO-WORLD
    => (1
        ;; This value is arbitrary.
        2)
    ^

Note how the indentation and the comment of (1 2) were left alone,
but the output and the first return value got updated.

Alternatively, C-u 1 mgl-pax-transcribe will emit commented markup:

    (values (princ :hello) (list 1 2))
    ;.. HELLO
    ;=> :HELLO
    ;=> (1 2)

C-u 0 mgl-pax-retranscribe-region will turn commented into
non-commented markup. In general, the numeric prefix argument is the
index of the syntax to be used in *TRANSCRIBE-SYNTAXES*. Without a
prefix argument, mgl-pax-retranscribe-region will not change the
markup style.

Finally, not only do both functions work at any indentation level
but in comments too:

    ;;;; (values (princ :hello) (list 1 2))
    ;;;; .. HELLO
    ;;;; => :HELLO
    ;;;; => (1 2)

The dynamic environment of the transcription is determined by the
:DYNENV argument of the enclosing cl-transcript code block (see
Controlling the Dynamic Environment).

Transcription support in Emacs can be enabled by loading
src/mgl-pax.el. See Emacs Setup.

### Transcript API

- [function] TRANSCRIBE INPUT OUTPUT &KEY UPDATE-ONLY (INCLUDE-NO-OUTPUT UPDATE-ONLY) (INCLUDE-NO-VALUE UPDATE-ONLY) (ECHO T) (CHECK-CONSISTENCY *TRANSCRIBE-CHECK-CONSISTENCY*) DEFAULT-SYNTAX (INPUT-SYNTAXES *TRANSCRIBE-SYNTAXES*) (OUTPUT-SYNTAXES *TRANSCRIBE-SYNTAXES*) DYNENV

    Read forms from INPUT and write them (iff ECHO) to OUTPUT
    followed by any output and return values produced by calling EVAL on
    the form. The variables *, **, ***,
    /, //, ///, -, +,
    ++, +++ are locally bound and updated as in a
    REPL. Since TRANSCRIBE EVALuates
    arbitrary code anyway, forms are read with *READ-EVAL* T.

    INPUT can be a stream or a string, while OUTPUT can be a stream or
    NIL, in which case output goes into a string. The return value is
    the OUTPUT stream or the string that was constructed.

    Go up to Transcribing with Emacs for nice examples. A more
    mind-bending one is this:

        (transcribe "(princ 42) " nil)
        => "(princ 42)
        .. 42
        => 42
        "

    However, the above may be a bit confusing since this documentation
    uses TRANSCRIBE markup syntax in this very example, so let's do it
    differently. If we have a file with these contents:

        (values (princ 42) (list 1 2))

    it is transcribed to:

        (values (princ 42) (list 1 2))
        .. 42
        => 42
        => (1 2)

    Output to all standard streams is captured and printed with
    the :OUTPUT prefix (".."). The return values above are printed
    with the :READABLE prefix ("=>"). Note how these prefixes are
    always printed on a new line to facilitate parsing.

    Updating

    TRANSCRIBE is able to parse its own output. If we transcribe the
    previous output above, we get it back exactly. However, if we remove
    all output markers, leave only a placeholder value marker and
    pass :UPDATE-ONLY T with source:

        (values (princ 42) (list 1 2))
        =>

    we get this:

        (values (princ 42) (list 1 2))
        => 42
        => (1 2)

    With UPDATE-ONLY, the printed output of a form is transcribed only
    if there were output markers in the source. Similarly, with
    UPDATE-ONLY, return values are transcribed only if there were value
    markers in the source.

    No Output/Values

    If the form produces no output or returns no values, then whether or
    not output and values are transcribed is controlled by
    INCLUDE-NO-OUTPUT and INCLUDE-NO-VALUE, respectively. By default,
    neither is on so:

        (values)
        ..
        =>

    is transcribed to

        (values)

    With UPDATE-ONLY true, we probably wouldn't like to lose those
    markers since they were put there for a reason. Hence, with
    UPDATE-ONLY, INCLUDE-NO-OUTPUT and INCLUDE-NO-VALUE default to true.
    So, with UPDATE-ONLY the above example is transcribed to:

        (values)
        ..
        => ; No value

    where the last line is the :NO-VALUE prefix.

    Consistency Checks

    If CHECK-CONSISTENCY is true, then TRANSCRIBE signals a continuable
    TRANSCRIPTION-OUTPUT-CONSISTENCY-ERROR whenever a form's output as a
    string is different from what was in INPUT, provided that INPUT
    contained the output. Similarly, for values, a continuable
    TRANSCRIPTION-VALUES-CONSISTENCY-ERROR is signalled if a value read
    from the source does not print as the as the value returned by EVAL.
    This allows readable values to be hand-indented without failing
    consistency checks:

        (list 1 2)
        => ;; This is commented, too.
           (1
              ;; Funny indent.
              2)

    See Transcript Consistency Checking for the full picture.

    Unreadable Values

    The above scheme involves READ, so consistency of unreadable values
    cannot be treated the same. In fact, unreadable values must even be
    printed differently for transcribe to be able to read them back:

        (defclass some-class () ())
        
        (defmethod print-object ((obj some-class) stream)
          (print-unreadable-object (obj stream :type t)
            (format stream "~%~%end")))
        
        (make-instance 'some-class)
        ==> #<SOME-CLASS 
        -->
        --> end>

    where "==>" is the :UNREADABLE prefix and "-->" is the
    :UNREADABLE-CONTINUATION prefix. As with outputs, a consistency
    check between an unreadable value from the source and the value from
    EVAL is performed with STRING= by default. That is, the value from
    EVAL is printed to a string and compared to the source value. Hence,
    any change to unreadable values will break consistency checks. This
    is most troublesome with instances of classes with the default
    PRINT-OBJECT method printing the memory address. See
    Finer-Grained Consistency Checks.

    Errors

    If an ERROR condition is signalled, the error is printed to the
    output and no values are returned.

        (progn
          (print "hello")
          (error "no greeting"))
        ..
        .. "hello" 
        .. debugger invoked on SIMPLE-ERROR:
        ..   no greeting

    To keep the textual representation somewhat likely to be portable,
    the printing is done with (FORMAT T "#<~S ~S>" (TYPE-OF
    ERROR) (PRINC-TO-STRING ERROR)). SIMPLE-CONDITIONs are formatted to
    strings with SIMPLE-CONDITION-FORMAT-CONTROL and
    SIMPLE-CONDITION-FORMAT-ARGUMENTS.

    Syntaxes

    Finally, a transcript may employ different syntaxes for the output
    and values of different forms. When INPUT is read, the syntax for
    each form is determined by trying to match all prefixes from all
    syntaxes in INPUT-SYNTAXES against a line. If there are no output or
    values for a form in INPUT, then the syntax remains undetermined.

    When OUTPUT is written, the prefixes to be used are looked up in
    DEFAULT-SYNTAX of OUTPUT-SYNTAXES, if DEFAULT-SYNTAX is not NIL. If
    DEFAULT-SYNTAX is NIL, then the syntax used by the same form in the
    INPUT is used or (if that could not be determined) the syntax of the
    previous form. If there was no previous form, then the first syntax
    if OUTPUT-SYNTAXES is used.

    To produce a transcript that's executable Lisp code,
    use :DEFAULT-SYNTAX :COMMENTED-1:

        (make-instance 'some-class)
        ;==> #<SOME-CLASS
        ;-->
        ;--> end>
        
        (list 1 2)
        ;=> (1
        ;->    2)

    To translate the above to uncommented syntax,
    use :DEFAULT-SYNTAX :DEFAULT. If DEFAULT-SYNTAX is NIL (the
    default), the same syntax will be used in the output as in the input
    as much as possible.

    Dynamic Environment

    If DYNENV is non-NIL, then it must be a function that establishes
    the dynamic environment in which transcription shall take place. It
    is called with a single argument: a thunk (a function of no
    arguments). See Controlling the Dynamic Environment for an example.

- [variable] *TRANSCRIBE-CHECK-CONSISTENCY* NIL

    The default value of TRANSCRIBE's CHECK-CONSISTENCY argument.

- [variable] *TRANSCRIBE-SYNTAXES* ((:DEFAULT (:OUTPUT "..") (:NO-VALUE "=> ; No value") (:READABLE "=>")
  (:UNREADABLE "==>") (:UNREADABLE-CONTINUATION "-->"))
 (:COMMENTED-1 (:OUTPUT ";..") (:NO-VALUE ";=> ; No value") (:READABLE ";=>")
  (:READABLE-CONTINUATION ";->") (:UNREADABLE ";==>")
  (:UNREADABLE-CONTINUATION ";-->"))
 (:COMMENTED-2 (:OUTPUT ";;..") (:NO-VALUE ";;=> ; No value")
  (:READABLE ";;=>") (:READABLE-CONTINUATION ";;->") (:UNREADABLE ";;==>")
  (:UNREADABLE-CONTINUATION ";;-->")))

    The default syntaxes used by TRANSCRIBE for reading and writing
    lines containing output and values of an evaluated form.

    A syntax is a list of of the form (SYNTAX-ID &REST PREFIXES) where
    PREFIXES is a list of (PREFIX-ID PREFIX-STRING) elements. For
    example the syntax :COMMENTED-1 looks like this:

        (:commented-1
         (:output ";..")
         (:no-value ";=>  No value")
         (:readable ";=>")
         (:readable-continuation ";->")
         (:unreadable ";==>")
         (:unreadable-continuation ";-->"))

    All of the above prefixes must be defined for every syntax except
    for :READABLE-CONTINUATION. If that's missing (as in the :DEFAULT
    syntax), then the following value is read with READ and printed with
    PRIN1 (hence no need to mark up the following lines).

    When writing, an extra space is added automatically if the line to
    be prefixed is not empty. Similarly, the first space following the
    prefix is discarded when reading.

    See TRANSCRIBE for how the actual syntax to be used is selected.

- [condition] TRANSCRIPTION-ERROR ERROR

    Represents syntactic errors in the SOURCE argument
    of TRANSCRIBE and also serves as the superclass of
    TRANSCRIPTION-CONSISTENCY-ERROR.

- [condition] TRANSCRIPTION-CONSISTENCY-ERROR TRANSCRIPTION-ERROR

    A common superclass for
    TRANSCRIPTION-OUTPUT-CONSISTENCY-ERROR and
    TRANSCRIPTION-VALUES-CONSISTENCY-ERROR.

- [condition] TRANSCRIPTION-OUTPUT-CONSISTENCY-ERROR TRANSCRIPTION-CONSISTENCY-ERROR

    Signalled (with CERROR) by TRANSCRIBE when invoked
    with :CHECK-CONSISTENCY and the output of a form is not the same as
    what was parsed.

- [condition] TRANSCRIPTION-VALUES-CONSISTENCY-ERROR TRANSCRIPTION-CONSISTENCY-ERROR

    Signalled (with CERROR) by TRANSCRIBE when invoked
    with :CHECK-CONSISTENCY and the values of a form are inconsistent
    with their parsed representation.

### Transcript Consistency Checking

The main use case for consistency checking is detecting
out-of-date examples in documentation, although using it for writing
tests is also a possibility. Here, we focus on the former.

When a Markdown code block tagged cl-transcript is processed
during Generating Documentation, the code in it is replaced with
the output of with (TRANSCRIBE <CODE> NIL :UPDATE-ONLY T
:CHECK-CONSISTENCY T). Suppose we have the following example of the
function GREET, that prints hello and returns 7.

    ```cl-transcript
    (greet)
    .. hello
    => 7
    ```

Now, if we change GREET to print or return something else, a
TRANSCRIPTION-CONSISTENCY-ERROR will be signalled during
documentation generation. Then we may fix the documentation or
CONTINUE from the error.

By default, comparisons of previous to current output, readable and
unreadable return values are performed with STRING=, EQUAL, and
STRING=, respectively, which is great in the simple case.
Non-determinism aside, exact matching becomes brittle as soon as the
notoriously unportable pretty printer is used or when unreadable
objects are printed with their #<> syntax, especially when
PRINT-UNREADABLE-OBJECT is used with :IDENTITY T.

#### Finer-Grained Consistency Checks

To get around this problem, consistency checking of output,
readable and unreadable values can be customized individually by
supplying TRANSCRIBE with a CHECK-CONSISTENCY argument
like ((:OUTPUT <OUTPUT-CHECK>) (:READABLE
<READABLE-CHECK>) (:UNREADABLE <UNREADABLE-CHECK>)). In this case,
<OUTPUT-CHECK> may be NIL, T, or a function designator.

- If it's NIL or there is no :OUTPUT entry in the list, then the
  output is not checked for consistency.

- If it's T, then the outputs are compared with the default,
  STRING=.

- If it's a function designator, then it's called with two strings
  and must return whether they are consistent with each other.

The case of <READABLE-CHECK> and <UNREADABLE-CHECK> is similar.

Code blocks tagged cl-transcript can take arguments, which they
pass on to TRANSCRIBE. The following shows how to check only the
output.

    ```cl-transcript (:check-consistency ((:output t)))
    (error "Oh, no.")
    .. debugger invoked on SIMPLE-ERROR:
    ..   Oh, no.
    
    (make-condition 'simple-error)
    ==> #<SIMPLE-ERROR {1008A81533}>
    ```

#### Controlling the Dynamic Environment

The dynamic environment in which forms in the transcript are
evaluated can be controlled via the :DYNENV argument of
cl-transcript.

    ```cl-transcript (:dynenv my-transcript)
    ...
    ```

In this case, instead of calling TRANSCRIBE directly, the call will
be wrapped in a function of no arguments and passed to the function
MY-TRANSCRIPT, which establishes the desired dynamic environment
and calls its argument. The following definition of MY-TRANSCRIPT
simply packages up oft-used settings to TRANSCRIBE.

    (defun my-transcript (fn)
      (let ((*transcribe-check-consistency*
              '((:output my-transcript-output=)
                (:readable equal)
                (:unreadable nil))))
        (funcall fn)))
    
    (defun my-transcript-output= (string1 string2)
      (string= (my-transcript-normalize-output string1)
               (my-transcript-normalize-output string2)))
    
    (defun my-transcript-normalize-output (string)
      (squeeze-whitespace (delete-trailing-whitespace (delete-comments string))))

A more involved solution could rebind global variables set in
transcripts, unintern symbols created or even create a temporary
package for evaluation.

#### Utilities for Consistency Checking

- [function] SQUEEZE-WHITESPACE STRING

    Replace consecutive whitespace characters with a single space in
    STRING and trim whitespace from the right. This is useful to undo
    the effects of pretty printing when building comparison functions
    for TRANSCRIBE.

- [function] DELETE-TRAILING-WHITESPACE STRING

    Delete whitespace characters after the last non-whitespace
    character in each line in STRING.

- [function] DELETE-COMMENTS STRING &KEY (PATTERN ";")

    For each line in STRING delete the rest of the line after and
    including the first occurrence of PATTERN. On changed lines, delete
    trailing whitespace too. This function does not parse STRING as Lisp
    forms, hence all occurrences of PATTERN (even those seemingly in
    string literals) are recognized as comments.

    Let's define a comparison function:

        (defun string=/no-comments (string1 string2)
          (string= (delete-comments string1) (delete-comments string2)))

    And use it to check consistency of output:

        ```cl-transcript (:check-consistency ((:output string=/no-comments)))
        (format t "hello~%world")
        .. hello     ; This is the first line.
        .. world     ; This is the second line.
        ```

    Just to make sure the above example works, here it is without being
    quoted.

        (format t "hello~%world")
        .. hello     ; This is the first line.
        .. world     ; This is the second line.

## Parsing

### Parsing Names

When encountering a word such as CLASSes in a docstring, PAX
needs to find the name, and how that's done varies slightly.
Codification, for example, looks for interesting names,
Navigating Sources in Emacs for names with Lisp DEFINITIONS, and Linking for names with any kind of
definition.

This is not as straightforward as it sounds because it needs to
handle cases like nonREADable, PRINTed, and all the various forms of
Linking in docstrings as well as in comments, and the (NAME
LOCATIVE) syntax in DEFSECTION.

- [glossary-term] word

    A word is a string from which we want to extract a name. When
    Navigating, the word is
    slime-sexp-at-point or the label of a Markdown reference link if point
    is over one. Similarly, when Generating Documentation, it is a
    non-empty string between whitespace characters in a docstring or the
    label of a Markdown reference link.

- [glossary-term] raw name

    A raw name is a string from which a name may be read. Raw names
    correspond to an intermediate parsing step between words an names.
    See Names in Raw Names.

- [glossary-term] name

    A name is a DRef name. That is, a symbol, a
    string or a nested list of the previous associated with a
    definition, whose kind is given by a locative.

Depending on the context, trimming and depluralization may be
enabled (see Raw Names in Words), while the possible names may be
restricted to symbols (see Names in Raw Names).

- Trimming: Enabled for M-. Defaulting and Codification.

- Depluralization: Enabled when the word is part of the normal
  flow of text (i.e. not for Specific Reflink with Text,
  Unspecific Reflink with Text and various Elisp functions such as
  mgl-pax-apropos unless they determine their argument from buffer
  contents).

- Symbols only: This is the case for Codification and
  Unspecific Autolink to prevent string-based definitions from
  littering the documentation with links without the control
  provided by explicitly IMPORTing symbols.

For a word, a number of raw names is generated by trimming
delimiter characters and plural markers, and for each raw name a
number of names are considered until one is found suitable in the
context. The following subsections describe the details of the
parsing algorithm.

#### Raw Names in Words

From words, raw names are parsed by trimming some
prefixes and suffixes. For a given word, multiple raw names are
considered in the following order.

1. The entire word.

2. Trimming the following characters from the left of the word:

        #<{;"'`

3. Trimming the following characters from the right of the word:

        ,;:.>}"'`

4. Trimming both of the previous two at the same time.

5. From the result of 4., If a word ends with what looks like a plural marker (case-insensitive),
then a name is created by removing it. For example, from the word
BUSES the plural marker ES is removed to produce the name BUS.
The list of plural markers considered is SES (e.g. GASSES),
ES (e.g. BUSES), S (e.g. CARS), ZES (e.g. FEZZES), and
REN (e.g. CHILDREN).

6. From the result of 4., removing the prefix before the first, and the suffix after the last
uppercase character if it contains at least one lowercase character.

#### Names in Raw Names

For each raw name from Raw Names in Words, various names
may be considered until one is found that's suitable in the context.

The following examples list the names considered for a given raw
name, assuming that READTABLE-CASE is :UPCASE as well as that FOO
and |Foo| are interned.

- "foo": FOO, "foo", "FOO" (rules 1, 2, 3)

- "FOO": FOO, "FOO" (rules 1, 2)

- "Foo": "Foo", "FOO" (rules 2, 3)

- "|Foo|": |Foo| (rule 4)

- "\"foo\"": "foo" (rule 5)

The rules are:

1. If the raw name is not mixed case (i.e. it doesn't have both
   upper- and lowercase characters) and it names an interned
   symbol (subject to the current Package and Readtable), then that
   symbol is considered as a name.

2. The raw name itself (a string) is considered a name.

3. The raw name upcased or downcased according to
   READTABLE-CASE (subject to the current
   readtable) but still as a string. This
   is to allow [dref][package] to refer to the "DREF"
   package regardless of whether the symbol DREF is interned in
   the current package.

4. If the raw name is explicitly a symbol (it starts with #\|),
   and it names an interned symbol (subject to the current
   Package and Readtable), then that symbol is considered as a name
   and nothing else.

5. If the raw name has an embedded string (it starts with #\") and
   READ-FROM-STRING can read the embedded string from it, then that
   string is considered as a name and nothing else.

<br/>
For example, when M-. is pressed while point is over
nonREADable., the last word of the sentence It may be
nonREADable., the following raw names are considered until one is
found with a definition:

1. The entire word, "nonREADable.".

2. Trimming left does not produce a new raw name.

3. Trimming right removes the dot and gives "nonREADable".

4. Trimming both is the same as trimming right.

5. No plural markers are found.

6. The lowercase prefix and suffix is removed around the uppercase
   core, giving "READ". This names an interned symbol which has a
   definition, so M-. will visit it.

When Generating Documentation, Autolinking behaves similarly.

### Parsing Locatives

Locatives are parsed almost as if by READ. They are found in
buffer contents around a word when M-. Defaulting or
Generating Documentation, and in the string entered when
M-. Prompting, with a similar distinction when
Browsing Live Documentation.

Parsing deviates from READ in the following ways.

- No new symbols are INTERNed during parsing. If an expression
  contains uninterned symbols, then it is not parsable as a
  locative.

- Read-time evaluation (#.) follows normal READ semantics.
  Thus, (method ((eql #.(find-package 'cl)))) may INTERN the
  symbol CL.

- A locative that involves unreadable objects that print using the
  #< syntax (e.g. (METHOD ((EQL #<PACKAGE DREF>)))) is parsable
  in the context of a name if each unreadable object in the
  locative occurs in one of the DEFINITIONS of that name and it
  prints to an equivalent string (e.g. #<PACKAGE DREF> above).

- [glossary-term] prints to an equivalent string

    An object with an unreadable representation is said to print to
    some string S if its PRIN1 representation (under WITH-STANDARD-IO-SYNTAX
    but in the current package and with *PRINT-READABLY* NIL) is the same as S, where consecutive whitepace characters are
    replaced with a single space in both strings, and the comparison is case-insensitive.

    See the related concept of stable printed locative, that requires
    the printed representation of entire locatives to be unique and
    non-changing to support Linking.

## Writing Extensions

### Adding New Locatives

Once everything in Extending DRef has been done,
there are only a couple of PAX generic functions left to extend.

- [generic-function] DOCUMENT-OBJECT* OBJECT STREAM

    Write OBJECT in *FORMAT* to STREAM.
    Specialize this on a subclass of DREF if that subclass is
    not RESOLVEable, else on the type of object it resolves to. This
    function is for extension only. Don't call it directly.

- [generic-function] EXPORTABLE-REFERENCE-P PACKAGE SYMBOL LOCATIVE-TYPE LOCATIVE-ARGS

    Return true if SYMBOL is to be exported from
    PACKAGE when it occurs in a DEFSECTION in a reference with
    LOCATIVE-TYPE and LOCATIVE-ARGS. SYMBOL is accessible in
    PACKAGE.

    The default method calls EXPORTABLE-LOCATIVE-TYPE-P with
    LOCATIVE-TYPE and ignores the other arguments.

    By default, SECTIONs and GLOSSARY-TERMs are not exported although
    they are EXPORTABLE-LOCATIVE-TYPE-P. To export symbols naming
    sections from MGL-PAX, the following method could be added:

        (defmethod exportable-reference-p ((package (eql (find-package 'mgl-pax)))
                                           symbol (locative-type (eql 'section))
                                           locative-args)
          t)

- [generic-function] EXPORTABLE-LOCATIVE-TYPE-P LOCATIVE-TYPE

    Return true if symbols in references with
    LOCATIVE-TYPE are to be exported by default when they occur in a
    DEFSECTION. The default method returns T, while the methods for
    locative types SECTION, GLOSSARY-TERM,
    PACKAGE, ASDF:SYSTEM, METHOD and
    INCLUDE return NIL.

    This function is called by the default method of
    EXPORTABLE-REFERENCE-P to decide what symbols DEFSECTION shall
    export when its EXPORT argument is true.

Also note that due to the Home Section logic, especially for
locative types with string names, DREF-EXT:DOCSTRING* should
probably return a non-NIL package.

### Locative Aliases

DEFINE-LOCATIVE-ALIAS can be used to help M-. and Specific Autolinks disambiguate
references based on the context of a name as described on Parsing.

The following example shows how to make docstrings read
more naturally by defining an alias.

    (defclass my-string ()
      ())
    
    (defgeneric my-string (obj)
      (:documentation "Convert OBJ to MY-STRING."))
    
    ;;; This version of FOO has a harder to read docstring because
    ;;; it needs to disambiguate the MY-STRING reference.
    (defun foo (x)
      "FOO takes and argument X, a [MY-STRING][class] object.")
    
    ;;; Define OBJECT as an alias for the CLASS locative.
    (define-locative-alias object class)
    
    ;;; Note how no explicit link is needed anymore.
    (defun foo (x)
      "FOO takes an argument X, a MY-CLASS object.")

Similarly, defining the indefinite articles as aliases of the CLASS
locative can reduce the need for explicit linking.

    (define-locative-alias a class)
    (define-locative-alias an class)

Since these are unlikely to be universally helpful, make sure not to
export the symbols A and AN.

### Extending DOCUMENT

For all definitions that it encounters, DOCUMENT calls
DOCUMENT-OBJECT* to generate documentation. The following utilities
are for writing new DOCUMENT-OBJECT* methods, which emit Markdown.

- [variable] *FORMAT*

    Bound by DOCUMENT to its FORMAT argument, this allows Markdown
    output to depend on the output format.

- [macro] WITH-HEADING (STREAM &KEY DREF LINK-TITLE-TO) &BODY BODY

    Write a Markdown heading with the DOCTITLE of DREF to STREAM.

    - DREF defaults to the definition for which documentation is
      currently being generated.

    - Nested WITH-HEADINGs produce nested headings.

    - If *DOCUMENT-LINK-SECTIONS*, generate anchors based on DREF.

    - LINK-TITLE-TO behaves like the LINK-TITLE-TO argument of
      DEFSECTION.

- [generic-function] DOCTITLE* OBJECT

    DOCTITLE* extends DOCTITLE in the same way
    as DOCSTRING* extends DOCSTRING.

    The default method returns NIL.

    This function is for extension only. Do not call it directly.

- [macro] DOCUMENTING-DEFINITION (STREAM &KEY DREF PACKAGE READTABLE (ARGLIST NIL)) &BODY BODY

    Write DREF to STREAM as described in
    *DOCUMENT-MARK-UP-SIGNATURES*, and establish DREF as a
     Local Definition for the processing of BODY.

    - DREF defaults to the definition for which documentation is
      currently being generated.

    - If DREF has a DOCTITLE, then it is PRINCed after the
      LOCATIVE-TYPE (see Markdown in Titles). Else, (DREF-NAME DREF)
      is printed subject to *DOCUMENT-DOWNCASE-UPPERCASE-CODE* but with
      all Markdown and MathJax markup escaped.

    - *PACKAGE* and *READTABLE* are bound to PACKAGE and READTABLE for
      the duration of printing the ARGLIST and the processing of BODY.
      If either is NIL, then a default value is computed as described in
      Package and Readtable.

    - ARGLIST:

        - If it is not provided, then it defaults to (ARGLIST DREF).

        - If NIL, then it is not printed.

        - If it is a list, then it is must be a lambda list and
          is printed without the outermost parens and with the package
          names removed from the argument names.

        - If its is a string, then it must be valid Markdown.

    - It is not allowed to have WITH-HEADING within the dynamic
      extent of BODY.

- [macro] WITH-DISLOCATED-NAMES NAMES &BODY BODY

    For each name in NAMES, establish a Local Definition.

- [function] DOCUMENT-DOCSTRING DOCSTRING STREAM &KEY (INDENTATION "    ") EXCLUDE-FIRST-LINE-P (PARAGRAPHP T)

    Write DOCSTRING to STREAM, sanitizing the Markdown from it, performing Codification and
    Linking, finally prefixing each line with INDENTATION. The prefix
    is not added to the first line if EXCLUDE-FIRST-LINE-P. If
    PARAGRAPHP, then add a newline before and after the output.

- [function] ESCAPE-MARKDOWN STRING &KEY (ESCAPE-INLINE T) (ESCAPE-MATHJAX T) (ESCAPE-HTML T) (ESCAPE-BLOCK T)

    Backslash escape Markdown constructs in STRING.

    - If ESCAPE-INLINE, then escape the following characters:

            *_`[]\

    - If ESCAPE-MATHJAX, then escape $ characters.

    - If ESCAPE-HTML, then escape the following characters:

            <&

    - If ESCAPE-BLOCK, then escape whatever is necessary to avoid
      starting a new Markdown block (e.g. a paragraph, heading, etc).

- [function] PRIN1-TO-MARKDOWN OBJECT &KEY (ESCAPE-INLINE T) (ESCAPE-MATHJAX T) (ESCAPE-HTML T) (ESCAPE-BLOCK T)

    Like PRIN1-TO-STRING, but bind *PRINT-CASE* depending on
    *DOCUMENT-DOWNCASE-UPPERCASE-CODE* and *FORMAT*, and
    ESCAPE-MARKDOWN.

### Sections

SECTION objects rarely need to be dissected since
DEFSECTION and DOCUMENT cover most needs. However, it is plausible
that one wants to subclass them and maybe redefine how they are
presented.

- [class] SECTION

    DEFSECTION stores its NAME, TITLE, PACKAGE,
    READTABLE and ENTRIES arguments in SECTION
    objects.

- [reader] SECTION-NAME SECTION (:NAME)

    The name of the global variable whose value is
    this SECTION object.

- [reader] SECTION-PACKAGE SECTION (:PACKAGE)

    *PACKAGE* will be bound to this package when
    generating documentation for this section.

- [reader] SECTION-READTABLE SECTION (:READTABLE)

    *READTABLE* will be bound to this when generating
    documentation for this section.

- [reader] SECTION-TITLE SECTION (:TITLE)

    A title or NIL. Used in generated
    documentation (see Markdown Output) and is returned by DOCTITLE
    for SECTION objects and SECTION definitions.

- [function] SECTION-LINK-TITLE-TO SECTION

- [function] SECTION-ENTRIES SECTION

    A list of Markdown docstrings and XREFs in the order they
    occurred in DEFSECTION.

### Glossary Terms

GLOSSARY-TERM objects rarely need to be dissected since
DEFINE-GLOSSARY-TERM and DOCUMENT cover most needs. However, it is
plausible that one wants to subclass them and maybe redefine how
they are presented.

- [class] GLOSSARY-TERM

    See DEFINE-GLOSSARY-TERM.

- [reader] GLOSSARY-TERM-NAME GLOSSARY-TERM (:NAME)

    The name of the global variable whose value is
    this GLOSSARY-TERM object.

- [reader] GLOSSARY-TERM-TITLE GLOSSARY-TERM (:TITLE)

    A title or NIL. Used in generated
    documentation (see Markdown Output) and is returned by DOCTITLE
    for GLOSSARY-TERM objects and GLOSSARY-TERM definitions..

- [reader] GLOSSARY-TERM-URL GLOSSARY-TERM (:URL)

    A string or NIL.
