# ITERATE Maintenance Fork

This is a fork of the Jonathan Amsterdam's `ITERATE` macro library, keeping it alive, maintained, and even repaired where flaws are found.

Current version is 1.6.0, after four 1.5 patch releases.  1.6.0 contains a number of bug fixes and a modification to the syntax (to make `with-hash-table` alternative syntax for `with-hashtable`).

Look for this README to be expanded as time permits.

ITERATE is maintained on gitlab.common-lisp.net and mirrored on GitHub.  Issues should be posted on common-lisp.net.
