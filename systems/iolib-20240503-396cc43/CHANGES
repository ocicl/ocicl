* Changes in 0.7.3 -> 0.8.0:

** Dependencies
* Add dependency on libFixPOSIX
* Add dependencies on SPLIT-SEQUENCE, IDNA

** API changes
* Add parameter NS to LOOKUP-HOSTNAME
* Remove accessor FD-NON-BLOCKING of FD-MIXIN
  - Stream file descriptors are always non-blocking now
* Rewrote CREATE-PROCESS and RUN-PROGRAM
  - Add attributes setuid, setgid, resetids and cwd
  - Coalesce process name and arguments into a single parameter
  - Remove keyarg SEARCH
  - Redirect standard descriptors to pipes by default
  - Add support for PTYs
  - Add keyarg EXTERNAL-FORMAT
  - Keep standard streams unbound in a PROCESS instance if not connected
  - Use /bin/sh as system shell
* RUN-PROGRAM: a null EXTERNAL-FORMAT will make it return STDOUT and STDERR as octet arrays
* PROCESS-WAIT: change return values
  - Return only the exit status on normal exit otherwise
    (values signal coredump-p), signal being a keyword
* PROCESS-KILL: make the signal optional(default SIGTERM) and allow keywords too
* Turn PROCESS-STATUS, PROCESS-ACTIVEP and PROCESS-KILL into generic functions
* Export GET-MONOTONIC-TIME from IOLIB.OS
* Allow passing a FOREIGN-POINTER to SEND-TO
* ACCEPT-CONNECTION now returns the remote port as third value for TCP sockets
* Remove stream finalizers
* Add keyarg DUP to MAKE-SOCKET-FROM-FD, null by default
* DELETE-FILES: avoid following symlinks by default, add a keyword argument to enable it

** New features
* Add support for IDN to LOOKUP-HOSTNAME
* Wrap syscalls sendfile(), syslog()
* Add accessor WTERMSIG*
* New socket options: IP_HDRINCL, IP_RECVERR, ICMP_FILTER
* Add raw sockets, sponsored by Walled Inc.
* DNS resolver: add support for SRV records
* Export DNS resolver functionality
* Add ABCL gray streams support

** Bug fixes:
* Various fixes for Scieneer
* Fix printing of DUAL-CHANNEL-GRAY-STREAM instances: print the actual type
* SOCKET-CONNECTED-P: ignore EINVAL as well
* Make sure that OPEN-STREAM-P works on stream sockets.
* %stream-read-sequence and %stream-write-sequence: fix case where (= start end)
* Fix segfault in LIST-NETWORK-INTERFACES
* EPOLL-MULTIPLEXER: allocate an array large enough to hold events for all FDs
* Remove event-loop exit timer after timeout

** Misc
* Reworked build system for ASDF3
  - Systems are now to be referred to as iolib/name, the oldsystem names are
    available for backwards-compatibility; likewise for package names
  - The new .asd files are iolib.asd and asdf2-compat/*.asd



* Changes since 0.7.1:

** Bug fixes:
- Don't redefine Alexandria functions (patch by Nikodemus Siivola)



* Changes since 0.7.0:

** Bug fixes:
- Only import a few symbols from ASDF into IOLIB.ASDF, which sometimes caused
  problems with ASDF2
- Fix compilation on OSX



* Changes since 0.6.0:

** API changes
- IOLIB.SOCKETS:LOOKUP-HOST was renamed to LOOKUP-HOSTNAME
- IOLIB.SOCKETS:IPV6-SOCKET-P was renamed to SOCKET-IPV6-P
- When creating an AF_LOCAL socket, IOLIB.SOCKETS:MAKE-SOCKET accepts :FILE as
  :TYPE synonim of :LOCAL
- IOLIB.SOCKETS:ACCEPT-CONNECTION : keyword arg TIMEOUT has been coalesced
  into WAIT
- IOLIB.SOCKETS:CONNECT : keyword arg TIMEOUT has been coalesced into WAIT

** New features
- Add support for abstract UNIX addresses (patch by Julian Stecklina)
- UNIX addresses are now printed as strings. Abstract addresses have a leading #\@

** Bug fixes:
- EVENT-DISPATCH now calculates the distance to the next timer correctly
  (reported by Ariel Badichi)
- fixed possible fd load in the the select() multiplexer (reported by Ariel
  Badichi)
- reading from socket streams with non-blocking FDs now works (reported by
  Chaitanya Gupta)
- make RESOLVER-ERROR actually a subtype of IOLIB-ERROR (reported by Ariel Badichi)
- socket syscalls that return EINTR now work
- when setting send/receive timeouts on blocking sockets, stream methods now
  properly signal ISYS:EWOULDBLOCK upon timeout
- fix bug in HEAP-PARENT, used in the multiplexer (reported by Ole Arndt on sbcl-devel)
- fix define-designator for when *print-case* is :downcase.

** Misc
- Sources have been reorganized, ASDF system files are now inside src/
