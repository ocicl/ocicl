Peter Keller is the author and current maintainer of the IOLib tutorial and
associated examples.

The file named "tutorial" is generated by a perl script called "gen-tutorial"
and an input file called "tutorial.tmpl". If the tutorial is not present, or
you are hacking on it to contribute back to it, then generate the tutorial by
typing 'make' at the command line while in the examples/ directory. The code
examples in the generated tutorial are picked out the the actual source codes
for the examples by the gen-tutorial program which allows much easier
management of the tutorial. The source code markers for the example code
sections used by the gen-tutorial program are detailed in the tutorial. The
method of inclusion of the examples is obvious and shown in the tutorial.tmpl
file.

Any submitted patches to the tutorial itself should be against the
tutorial.tmpl file and sent to the iolib development list. All tabs are to be
converted to 4 spaces. Patches against the tutorial source codes should also be
sent to the iolib development list.

Thank you.
