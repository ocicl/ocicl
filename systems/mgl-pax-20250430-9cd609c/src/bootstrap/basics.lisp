  "Define a documentation section and maybe export referenced symbols.
  A bit behind the scenes, a global variable with NAME is defined and
  is bound to a [SECTION][class] object. By convention, section names
  start with the character `@`. See @INTRODUCTION for an example.

  **Entries**

  ENTRIES consists of docstrings and references in any order.
  Docstrings are arbitrary strings in markdown format.

  References are [XREF][class]s given in the form `(NAME LOCATIVE)`.
  For example, `(FOO FUNCTION)` refers to the function `FOO`, `(@BAR
  SECTION)` says that `@BAR` is a subsection of this
  one. `(BAZ (METHOD () (T T T)))` refers to the default method of the
  three argument generic function `BAZ`. `(FOO FUNCTION)` is
  equivalent to `(FOO (FUNCTION))`. See the DRef DREF::@INTRODUCTION
  for more.

  The same name may occur in multiple references, typically with
  different locatives, but this is not required.

  The references are not LOCATEd until documentation is generated, so
  they may refer to things yet to be defined.

  **Exporting**

  If EXPORT is true (the default), NAME and the @NAMEs of references
  among ENTRIES which are SYMBOLs are candidates for exporting. A
  candidate symbol is exported if

  - it is [accessible][find-symbol] in PACKAGE, and

  - there is a reference to it in the section being defined which is
    approved by EXPORTABLE-REFERENCE-P.

  See DEFINE-PACKAGE if you use the export feature. The idea with
  confounding documentation and exporting is to force documentation of
  all exported symbols.

  **Misc**

  TITLE is a string containing markdown or NIL. If non-NIL, it
  determines the text of the heading in the generated output.
  LINK-TITLE-TO is a reference given as an `(NAME LOCATIVE)` pair or
  NIL, to which the heading will link when generating HTML. If not
  specified, the heading will link to its own anchor.

  When DISCARD-DOCUMENTATION-P (defaults to *DISCARD-DOCUMENTATION-P*)
  is true, ENTRIES will not be recorded to save memory."
