  """Integration into @SLIME's @M-. (`slime-edit-definition`) allows
  one to visit the SOURCE-LOCATION of a DREF::@DEFINITION. PAX extends
  standard Slime functionality by

  - adding support for all kinds of definitions (see e.g.
    [ASDF:SYSTEM][locative], [READTABLE][locative] in
    DREF::@BASIC-LOCATIVE-TYPES), not just the ones Slime knows about,

  - providing a portable way to refer to even standard definitions,

  - disambiguating the definition based on buffer content, and

  - adding more powerful completions.

  The definition is either determined from the buffer content at point
  or is prompted for. At the prompt, TAB-completion is available for
  both names and locatives. With a prefix argument (`C-u M-.`), the
  buffer contents are not consulted, and `\\M-.` always prompts.

  The `\\M-.` extensions can be enabled by loading `src/mgl-pax.el`. See
  @EMACS-SETUP. In addition, the Elisp command
  `mgl-pax-edit-parent-section` visits the source location of the
  section containing the definition with point in it.

  A close relative of `\\M-.` is `\\C-.` for @BROWSING-LIVE-DOCUMENTATION."""

  """When `@M-.` is invoked, it first tries to find a @NAME in the
  current buffer at point. If no name is found, then it
  [prompts][@M-.-PROMPTING].

  First, `(slime-sexp-at-point)` is taken as a @WORD, from which the
  @NAME will be [parsed][@parsing]. Then, candidate locatives are
  looked for before and after the @WORD. Thus, if a locative is the
  previous or the next expression, then `\\M-.` will go straight to the
  definition which corresponds to the locative. If that fails, `\\M-.`
  will try to find the definitions in the normal way, which may
  involve popping up an xref buffer and letting the user interactively
  select one of possible definitions.

  `\\M-.` works on parenthesized references, such as those in
  DEFSECTION:

  ```
  (defsection @foo ()
    (cos function))
  ```

  Here, when the cursor is on one of the characters of `\COS` or just
  after `\COS`, pressing `\\M-.` will visit the definition of the
  function `COS`.

  To play nice with @GENERATING-DOCUMENTATION, forms suitable for
  @AUTOLINKing are recognized:

      function cos
      cos function

  ... as well as @REFLINKs:

      [cos][function]
      [see this][cos function]

  ... and @MARKDOWN/INLINE-CODE:

      cos `function`
      `cos` function
      `cos` `function`

  Everything works the same way in comments and docstrings as in code.
  In the next example, pressing `\\M-.` on `RESOLVE*` will visit its
  denoted method:

  """At the minibuffer prompt, the DREF::@DEFINITIONS to edit
  can be specified as follows.

  - NAME: Refers to all DREF:DEFINITIONS of NAME with a [Lisp locative
    type][DREF:LISP-LOCATIVE-TYPES]. See these `NAME -> DEFINITIONS`
    examples:

          print    ->  PRINT FUNCTION
          PRINT    ->  PRINT FUNCTION
          MGL-PAX  ->  "mgl-pax" ASDF:SYSTEM, "MGL-PAX" package
          pax      ->  "PAX" PACKAGE
          "PAX"    ->  "PAX" PACKAGE

      Note that depending on the Lisp implementation there may be more
      definitions. For example, SBCL has an [UNKNOWN][locative]
      :DEFOPTIMIZER definition for `\PRINT`.

  - NAME LOCATIVE: Refers to a single definition (as in `(DREF:DREF
    NAME LOCATIVE)`). Example inputs of this form:

          print function
          dref-ext:docstring* (method nil (t))

  - LOCATIVE NAME: This has the same form as the previous: two sexps,
    but here the first one is the locative. If ambiguous, this is
    considered in addition to the previous one. Example inputs:

          function print
          (method nil (t)) dref-ext:docstring*

  In all of the above NAME is a PAX::@RAW-NAME, meaning that `\print`
  will be recognized as `\PRINT` and `\pax` as `"PAX"`.

  The package in which symbols are read is the Elisp
  `slime-current-package`. In Lisp buffers, this is the buffer's
  package, else it's the package of the Slime repl buffer.""")
