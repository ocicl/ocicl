  """Redirect to a definition in the context of the DREF::@REFERENCE
  designated by NAME and LOCATIVE. This PSEUDO locative is intended for
  things that have no explicit global definition.

  As an example, consider this part of a hypothetical documentation of
  CLOS:

      (defsection @clos ()
        (defmethod macro)
        (call-next-method (go (defmethod macro))))

  The GO reference exports the symbol CALL-NEXT-METHOD and also
  produces a terse redirection message in the documentation.

  GO behaves as described below.

  - A GO reference RESOLVEs to what NAME with LOCATIVE resolves to:

      ```cl-transcript (:dynenv pax-std-env)
      (resolve (dref 'xxx '(go (print function))))
      ==> #<FUNCTION PRINT>
      => T
      ```

  - The DOCSTRING of a GO reference is NIL.

  - SOURCE-LOCATION (thus `\\M-.`) returns the source location of the
    embedded reference:

      ```cl-transcript
      (equal (source-location (dref 'xxx '(go (print function))))
             (source-location (dref 'print 'function)))

  """This PSEUDO locative refers to a region of a file. SOURCE can be a
  [STRING][type] or a [PATHNAME][type], in which case the whole file
  is being pointed to, or it can explicitly supply START, END
  locatives. INCLUDE is typically used to include non-lisp files in
  the documentation (say markdown or Elisp as in the next example) or
  regions of Lisp source files. This can reduce clutter and
  duplication.

  ```
  (defsection @example-section ()
    (mgl-pax.el (include #.(asdf:system-relative-pathname
                            :mgl-pax "src/mgl-pax.el")

                          :footer-nl "```")))
  ```

  In the above example, when documentation is generated, the entire
  `src/mgl-pax.el` file is included in the markdown output surrounded
  by the strings given as HEADER-NL and FOOTER-NL. The documentation
  of `FOO-EXAMPLE` will be the region of the file from the
  SOURCE-LOCATION of the START reference (inclusive) to the
  SOURCE-LOCATION of the END reference (exclusive). If only one of
  START and END is specified, then they default to the beginning and
  end of the file, respectively.

  Since START and END are literal references, pressing `\\M-.` on
  `PAX.EL` will open the `src/mgl-pax.el` file and put the cursor on
  its first character. `\\M-.` on `FOO-EXAMPLE` will go to the source
  location of the `FOO` function.

  With the LAMBDA locative, one can specify positions in arbitrary
  files.

  - SOURCE is either an absolute pathname designator or a list
    matching the [destructuring lambda list][clhs] `(&KEY START END)`,
    where START and END must be NIL or `(<NAME> <LOCATIVE>)`
    lists (not evaluated) like a DEFSECTION entry. Their
    SOURCE-LOCATIONs constitute the bounds of the region of the file
    to be included. Note that the file of the source location of START
    and END must be the same. If SOURCE is a pathname designator, then
    it must be absolute so that the locative is context independent.

  - If specified, LINE-PREFIX is a string that's prepended to each
    line included in the documentation. For example, a string of four
    spaces makes markdown think it's a code block.

  - HEADER and FOOTER, if non-NIL, are printed before the included
    string.

  - HEADER-NL and FOOTER-NL, if non-NIL, are printed between two
    FRESH-LINE calls.

;;;; CLHS locative

  """Refers to definitions, glossary entries, sections, issues and
  issue summaries in the Common Lisp HyperSpec. These have no source
  location so @M-. will not work. What works is linking in
  documentation, including @BROWSING-LIVE-DOCUMENTATION. The generated
  links are relative to *DOCUMENT-HYPERSPEC-ROOT* and work even if
  *DOCUMENT-LINK-TO-HYPERSPEC* is NIL. All matching is
  case-insensitive.

  - *definitions*: These are typically unnecessary as DOCUMENT will
    produce the same link for e.g. `\\PPRINT`, `[PPRINT][function]`,
    or `[PPRINT][]` if *DOCUMENT-LINK-TO-HYPERSPEC* is non-NIL and the
    PPRINT function in the running Lisp is not @LINKABLE. When
    @BROWSING-LIVE-DOCUMENTATION, a slight difference is that
    everything is linkable, so using the CLHS link bypasses the page
    with the definition in the running Lisp.

      - *unambiguous definition*: `[pprint][clhs]` ([pprint][clhs])

      - *disambiguation page*: `[function][clhs]` ([function][clhs])

      - *specific*: `[function][(clhs class)]` ([function][(clhs class)])

  - *glossary terms*:

      - `[lambda list][(clhs glossary-term)]`
        ([lambda list][(clhs glossary-term)])

  - *issues*:

      - `[ISSUE:AREF-1D][clhs]` ([ISSUE:AREF-1D][clhs])

      - `[ISSUE:AREF-1D][(clhs section)]` ([ISSUE:AREF-1D][clhs])

  - *issue summaries*: These render
     as ([SUMMARY:CHARACTER-PROPOSAL:2-6-5][clhs]):

      - `[SUMMARY:CHARACTER-PROPOSAL:2-6-5][clhs]`

      - `[SUMMARY:CHARACTER-PROPOSAL:2-6-5][(clhs section)]`

      Since these summary ids are not particularly reader friendly,
      the anchor text a @SPECIFIC-REFLINK-WITH-TEXT may be used:

      - `[see this][SUMMARY:CHARACTER-PROPOSAL:2-6-5 (clhs section)]`
        ([see this][SUMMARY:CHARACTER-PROPOSAL:2-6-5 (clhs section)]).

  - *sections*:

      - *by section number*: `[3.4][clhs]` or `[3.4][(clhs
         section)]` ([3.4][clhs])

      - *by section title* (substring match): `[lambda lists][clhs]`
         or `[lambda lists][(clhs section)]` ([lambda lists][clhs])

      - *by filename*: `[03_d][clhs]` or `[03_d][(clhs
         section)]` ([03_d][clhs])

      - *by alias*: [Format directives][(clhs glossary-term)] are
         aliases of the sections describing them. Thus, `[~c][clhs]`
         is equivalent to `[22.3.1.1][clhs]` and `[Tilde C:
         Character][clhs]`. The full list is
         [*format-directive-alias-links* variable][docstring].

          Similarly, [reader macro][clhs] characters are aliases of
          the sections describing them. The full list is
          [*reader-macro-alias-links* variable][docstring].

          Finally, [loop keywords][(clhs glossary-term)] have aliases
          to the sections describing them. For example, the strings
          `loop:for`, `for` and `:for` are aliases of CLHS `6.1.2.1`.
          The `loop:*` aliases are convenient for completion at the
          prompt when @BROWSING-LIVE-DOCUMENTATION, while the other
          aliases are for defaulting to buffer contents.

  As the above examples show, the NESTED-LOCATIVE argument of the CLHS
  locative may be omitted. In that case, definitions, glossary terms,
  issues, issue summaries, and sections are considered in that order.
  Sections are considered last because a substring of a section title
  can be matched by chance easily.

  All examples so far used @REFLINKs. @AUTOLINKing also works if the
  @NAME is marked up as code or is [codified][ @codification] (e.g. in
  `COS clhs` (COS clhs).

  As mentioned above, `\\M-.` does not do anything over CLHS
  references. Slightly more usefully, the [live documentation
  browser][@browsing-live-documentation] understands CLHS links so one
  can enter inputs like `3.4 clhs`, `"lambda list" clhs` or
  `error (clhs function)`.
