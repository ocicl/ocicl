(defsection @transcripts (:title "Transcripts")
  "What are transcripts for? When writing a tutorial, one often wants
  to include a REPL session with maybe a few defuns and a couple of
  forms whose output or return values are shown. Also, in a function's
  docstring an example call with concrete arguments and return values
  speaks volumes. A transcript is a text that looks like a REPL
  session, but which has a light markup for printed output and return
  values, while no markup (i.e. prompt) for Lisp forms. PAX
  transcripts may include output and return values of all forms, or
  only selected ones. In either case, the transcript itself can be
  easily generated from the source code.

  The main worry associated with including examples in the
  documentation is that they tend to get out-of-sync with the code.
  This is solved by being able to parse back and update transcripts.
  In fact, this is exactly what happens during documentation
  generation with PAX. Code sections tagged with `cl-transcript` are
  retranscribed and checked for consistency (that is, no difference in
  output or return values). If the consistency check fails, an error
  is signalled that includes a reference to the object being
  documented.

  Going beyond documentation, transcript consistency checks can be
  used for writing simple tests in a very readable form. For example:

  ```cl-transcript
  (+ 1 2)
  => 3

  (values (princ :hello) (list 1 2))
  .. HELLO
  => :HELLO
  => (1 2)
  ```

  All in all, transcripts are a handy tool especially when combined
  with the Emacs support to regenerate them and with
  [PYTHONIC-STRING-READER][asdf:system]'s triple-quoted strings, that
  allow one to work with nested strings with less noise. The
  triple-quote syntax can be enabled with:

      (in-readtable pythonic-string-syntax)"

  "The default syntaxes used by TRANSCRIBE for reading and writing
  lines containing output and values of an evaluated form.

  A syntax is a list of of the form `(SYNTAX-ID &REST PREFIXES)` where
  `PREFIXES` is a list of `(PREFIX-ID PREFIX-STRING)` elements. For
  example the syntax :COMMENTED-1 looks like this:

  ```
  (:commented-1
   (:output \";..\")
   (:no-value \";=>  No value\")
   (:readable \";=>\")
   (:readable-continuation \";->\")
   (:unreadable \";==>\")
   (:unreadable-continuation \";-->\"))
  ```

  All of the above prefixes must be defined for every syntax except
  for :READABLE-CONTINUATION. If that's missing (as in the :DEFAULT
  syntax), then the following value is read with READ and printed with
  PRIN1 (hence no need to mark up the following lines).

  When writing, an extra space is added automatically if the line to
  be prefixed is not empty. Similarly, the first space following the
  prefix is discarded when reading.

  See TRANSCRIBE for how the actual syntax to be used is selected.")

  """Read forms from INPUT and write them (iff ECHO) to OUTPUT

  the form. The variables [*][variable], [**][], [\***][],
  [/][variable], [//][], [///][], [-][variable], [+][variable],
  [++][], [+++][] are locally bound and updated as in a
  [REPL]["Lisp read-eval-print loop" clhs]. Since TRANSCRIBE EVALuates
  arbitrary code anyway, forms are read with *READ-EVAL* T.

  INPUT can be a stream or a string, while OUTPUT can be a stream or
  NIL, in which case output goes into a string. The return value is
  the OUTPUT stream or the string that was constructed.

  Go up to @TRANSCRIBING-WITH-EMACS for nice examples. A more
  mind-bending one is this:

  ```cl-transcript
  (transcribe "(princ 42) " nil)
  => "(princ 42)
  .. 42
  => 42
  "
  ```

  However, the above may be a bit confusing since this documentation
  uses TRANSCRIBE markup syntax in this very example, so let's do it
  differently. If we have a file with these contents:

  ```
  (values (princ 42) (list 1 2))
  ```

  it is transcribed to:

  ```
  (values (princ 42) (list 1 2))
  .. 42
  => 42
  => (1 2)
  ```

  Output to all standard streams is captured and printed with
  the :OUTPUT prefix (`".."`). The return values above are printed
  with the :READABLE prefix (`"=>"`). Note how these prefixes are
  always printed on a new line to facilitate parsing.

  **Updating**

  TRANSCRIBE is able to parse its own output. If we transcribe the
  previous output above, we get it back exactly. However, if we remove
  all output markers, leave only a placeholder value marker and
  pass :UPDATE-ONLY T with source:

  ```
  (values (princ 42) (list 1 2))
  =>
  ```

  we get this:

  ```
  (values (princ 42) (list 1 2))
  => 42
  => (1 2)
  ```

  With UPDATE-ONLY, the printed output of a form is transcribed only
  if there were output markers in the source. Similarly, with
  UPDATE-ONLY, return values are transcribed only if there were value
  markers in the source.

  **No Output/Values**

  If the form produces no output or returns no values, then whether or
  not output and values are transcribed is controlled by
  INCLUDE-NO-OUTPUT and INCLUDE-NO-VALUE, respectively. By default,
  neither is on so:

  ```
  (values)
  ..
  =>
  ```

  is transcribed to

  ```
  (values)
  ```

  With UPDATE-ONLY true, we probably wouldn't like to lose those
  markers since they were put there for a reason. Hence, with
  UPDATE-ONLY, INCLUDE-NO-OUTPUT and INCLUDE-NO-VALUE default to true.
  So, with UPDATE-ONLY the above example is transcribed to:

  ```
  (values)
  ..
  => ; No value
  ```

  where the last line is the :NO-VALUE prefix.

  **Consistency Checks**

  If CHECK-CONSISTENCY is true, then TRANSCRIBE signals a continuable
  TRANSCRIPTION-OUTPUT-CONSISTENCY-ERROR whenever a form's output as a
  string is different from what was in INPUT, provided that INPUT
  contained the output. Similarly, for values, a continuable
  TRANSCRIPTION-VALUES-CONSISTENCY-ERROR is signalled if a value read
  from the source does not print as the as the value returned by EVAL.
  This allows readable values to be hand-indented without failing
  consistency checks:

  ```
  (list 1 2)
  => ;; This is commented, too.
     (1
        ;; Funny indent.
        2)
  ```

  See @TRANSCRIPT-CONSISTENCY-CHECKING for the full picture.

  **Unreadable Values**

  The above scheme involves READ, so consistency of unreadable values
  cannot be treated the same. In fact, unreadable values must even be
  printed differently for transcribe to be able to read them back:

  ```
  (defclass some-class () ())

  (defmethod print-object ((obj some-class) stream)
    (print-unreadable-object (obj stream :type t)
      (format stream "~%~%end")))

  (make-instance 'some-class)
  ==> #<SOME-CLASS 
  -->
  --> end>
  ```

  where `"==>"` is the :UNREADABLE prefix and `"-->"` is the
  :UNREADABLE-CONTINUATION prefix. As with outputs, a consistency
  check between an unreadable value from the source and the value from
  EVAL is performed with STRING= by default. That is, the value from
  EVAL is printed to a string and compared to the source value. Hence,
  any change to unreadable values will break consistency checks. This
  is most troublesome with instances of classes with the default
  PRINT-OBJECT method printing the memory address. See
  @TRANSCRIPT-FINER-GRAINED-CONSISTENCY-CHECKS.

  **Errors**

  If an ERROR condition is signalled, the error is printed to the
  output and no values are returned.

  ```cl-transcript
  (progn
    (print "hello")
    (error "no greeting"))
  ..
  .. "hello" 
  .. debugger invoked on SIMPLE-ERROR:
  ..   no greeting
  ```

  To keep the textual representation somewhat likely to be portable,
  the printing is done with `(FORMAT T "#<~S ~S>" (TYPE-OF
  ERROR) (PRINC-TO-STRING ERROR))`. SIMPLE-CONDITIONs are formatted to
  strings with SIMPLE-CONDITION-FORMAT-CONTROL and
  SIMPLE-CONDITION-FORMAT-ARGUMENTS.

  **Syntaxes**

  Finally, a transcript may employ different syntaxes for the output
  and values of different forms. When INPUT is read, the syntax for
  each form is determined by trying to match all prefixes from all
  syntaxes in INPUT-SYNTAXES against a line. If there are no output or
  values for a form in INPUT, then the syntax remains undetermined.

  When OUTPUT is written, the prefixes to be used are looked up in
  DEFAULT-SYNTAX of OUTPUT-SYNTAXES, if DEFAULT-SYNTAX is not NIL. If
  DEFAULT-SYNTAX is NIL, then the syntax used by the same form in the
  INPUT is used or (if that could not be determined) the syntax of the
  previous form. If there was no previous form, then the first syntax
  if OUTPUT-SYNTAXES is used.

  To produce a transcript that's executable Lisp code,
  use :DEFAULT-SYNTAX :COMMENTED-1:

  ```
  (make-instance 'some-class)
  ;==> #<SOME-CLASS
  ;-->
  ;--> end>

  (list 1 2)
  ;=> (1
  ;->    2)
  ```

  To translate the above to uncommented syntax,
  use :DEFAULT-SYNTAX :DEFAULT. If DEFAULT-SYNTAX is NIL (the
  default), the same syntax will be used in the output as in the input
  as much as possible.

  **Dynamic Environment**

  If DYNENV is non-NIL, then it must be a function that establishes
  the dynamic environment in which transcription shall take place. It
  is called with a single argument: a thunk (a function of no
  arguments). See @TRANSCRIPT-DYNENV for an example.

(defsection @transcribing-with-emacs (:title "Transcribing with Emacs")
  """Typical transcript usage from within Emacs is simple: add a Lisp
  form to a docstring or comment at any indentation level. Move the
  cursor right after the end of the form as if you were to evaluate it
  with `C-x C-e`. The cursor is marked by `#\^`:

      This is part of a docstring.

      ```cl-transcript
      (values (princ :hello) (list 1 2))^
      ```

  Note that the use of fenced code blocks with the language tag
  `cl-transcript` is only to tell PAX to perform consistency checks at
  documentation generation time.

  Now invoke the Elisp function `mgl-pax-transcribe` where the cursor
  is, and the fenced code block from the docstring becomes:

      (values (princ :hello) (list 1 2))
      .. HELLO
      => :HELLO
      => (1 2)
      ^

  Then you change the printed message and add a comment to the second
  return value:

      (values (princ :hello-world) (list 1 2))
      .. HELLO
      => :HELLO
      => (1
          ;; This value is arbitrary.
          2)

  When generating the documentation you get a
  TRANSCRIPTION-CONSISTENCY-ERROR because the printed output and the
  first return value changed, so you regenerate the documentation by
  marking the region bounded by `#\|` and the cursor at `#\^` in the
  example:

      |(values (princ :hello-world) (list 1 2))
      .. HELLO
      => :HELLO
      => (1
          ;; This value is arbitrary.
          2)
      ^

  then invoke the Elisp function `mgl-pax-retranscribe-region` to get:

      (values (princ :hello-world) (list 1 2))
      .. HELLO-WORLD
      => :HELLO-WORLD
      => (1
          ;; This value is arbitrary.
          2)
      ^

  Note how the indentation and the comment of `(1 2)` were left alone,
  but the output and the first return value got updated.

  Alternatively, `C-u 1 mgl-pax-transcribe` will emit commented markup:

      (values (princ :hello) (list 1 2))
      ;.. HELLO
      ;=> :HELLO
      ;=> (1 2)

  `C-u 0 mgl-pax-retranscribe-region` will turn commented into
  non-commented markup. In general, the numeric prefix argument is the
  index of the syntax to be used in *TRANSCRIBE-SYNTAXES*. Without a
  prefix argument, `mgl-pax-retranscribe-region` will not change the
  markup style.

  Finally, not only do both functions work at any indentation level
  but in comments too:

      ;;;; (values (princ :hello) (list 1 2))
      ;;;; .. HELLO
      ;;;; => :HELLO
      ;;;; => (1 2)

  The dynamic environment of the transcription is determined by the
  :DYNENV argument of the enclosing `cl-transcript` code block (see
  @TRANSCRIPT-DYNENV).

  Transcription support in Emacs can be enabled by loading
  `src/mgl-pax.el`. See @EMACS-SETUP.""")

(defsection @transcript-consistency-checking
    (:title "Transcript Consistency Checking")
  """The main use case for consistency checking is detecting
  out-of-date examples in documentation, although using it for writing
  tests is also a possibility. Here, we focus on the former.

  When a markdown code block tagged `cl-transcript` is processed
  during @GENERATING-DOCUMENTATION, the code in it is replaced with
  the output of with `(TRANSCRIBE <CODE> NIL :UPDATE-ONLY T
  :CHECK-CONSISTENCY T)`. Suppose we have the following example of the
  function `GREET`, that prints `hello` and returns 7.

      ```cl-transcript
      (greet)
      .. hello
      => 7
      ```

  Now, if we change `GREET` to print or return something else, a
  TRANSCRIPTION-CONSISTENCY-ERROR will be signalled during
  documentation generation. Then we may fix the documentation or
  [CONTINUE][restart] from the error.

  By default, comparisons of previous to current output, readable and
  unreadable return values are performed with STRING=, EQUAL, and
  STRING=, respectively, which is great in the simple case.
  Non-determinism aside, exact matching becomes brittle as soon as the
  notoriously unportable pretty printer is used or when unreadable
  objects are printed with their `#<>` syntax, especially when
  PRINT-UNREADABLE-OBJECT is used with `:IDENTITY T`.

(defsection @transcript-finer-grained-consistency-checks
    (:title "Finer-Grained Consistency Checks")
  """To get around this problem, consistency checking of output,
  readable and unreadable values can be customized individually by
  supplying TRANSCRIBE with a CHECK-CONSISTENCY argument
  like `((:OUTPUT <OUTPUT-CHECK>) (:READABLE
  <READABLE-CHECK>) (:UNREADABLE <UNREADABLE-CHECK>))`. In this case,
  `<OUTPUT-CHECK>` may be NIL, T, or a function designator.

  - If it's NIL or there is no :OUTPUT entry in the list, then the
    output is not checked for consistency.
  - If it's T, then the outputs are compared with the default,
    STRING=.
  - If it's a function designator, then it's called with two strings
    and must return whether they are consistent with each other.

  The case of `<READABLE-CHECK>` and `<UNREADABLE-CHECK>` is similar.

  Code blocks tagged `cl-transcript` can take arguments, which they
  pass on to TRANSCRIBE. The following shows how to check only the
  output.

  """The dynamic environment in which forms in the transcript are
  evaluated can be controlled via the :DYNENV argument of
  `cl-transcript`.

      ```cl-transcript (:dynenv my-transcript)
      ...
      ```

  In this case, instead of calling TRANSCRIBE directly, the call will
  be wrapped in a function of no arguments and passed to the function
  `MY-TRANSCRIPT`, which establishes the desired dynamic environment
  and calls its argument. The following definition of `MY-TRANSCRIPT`
  simply packages up oft-used settings to TRANSCRIBE.

  ```
  (defun my-transcript (fn)
    (let ((*transcribe-check-consistency*
            '((:output my-transcript-output=)
              (:readable equal)
              (:unreadable nil))))
      (funcall fn)))

  (defun my-transcript-output= (string1 string2)
    (string= (my-transcript-normalize-output string1)
             (my-transcript-normalize-output string2)))

  (defun my-transcript-normalize-output (string)
    (squeeze-whitespace (delete-trailing-whitespace (delete-comments string))))
  ```

  A more involved solution could rebind global variables set in
  transcripts, unintern symbols created or even create a temporary
  package for evaluation.

  Let's define a comparison function:

  ```cl-transcript (:dynenv pax-std-env)
  (defun string=/no-comments (string1 string2)
    (string= (delete-comments string1) (delete-comments string2)))

  And use it to check consistency of output:

      (format t "hello~%world")
      .. hello     ; This is the first line.
      .. world     ; This is the second line.
      ```

  Just to make sure the above example works, here it is without being
  quoted.

  ```cl-transcript (:check-consistency ((:output string=/no-comments)))
