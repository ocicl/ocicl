(defsection @browsing-live-documentation (:title "Browsing Live Documentation")
  """Documentation for definitions in the running Lisp can be browsed
  directly without generating documentation in the offline manner.
  HTML documentation, complete with @CODIFICATION and @LINKING, is
  generated from docstrings of all kinds of definitions and PAX
  SECTIONs in the running Lisp on the fly. This allows ad-hoc
  exploration of the Lisp, much like `describe-function`,
  `apropos-command` and other online help commands in Emacs, for which
  direct parallels are provided.

  Still, even without Emacs and @SLIME, limited functionality can be
  accessed through @PAX-LIVE-HOME-PAGE by starting the live
  documentation web server [manually][ensure-web-server].

  If @EMACS-SETUP has been done, the Elisp function
  `mgl-pax-document` (maybe bound to `\\C-.`) generates and displays
  documentation as a single HTML page. If necessary, a disambiguation
  page is generated with the documentation of all matching
  definitions. For example, to view the documentation of this very
  SECTION, one can do:

      M-x mgl-pax-document
      View Documentation of: pax::@browsing-live-documentation

  Alternatively, pressing `\\C-.` with point over the text
  `\pax::@browsing-live-documentation` in a buffer achieves the same
  effect.

  In interactive use, `mgl-pax-document` behaves similarly to
  [`\\M-.`][@NAVIGATING-IN-EMACS] except:

  - It shows the DOCUMENTation of some definition and does not visit
    its SOURCE-LOCATION.

  - It considers definitions with all LOCATIVE-TYPES not just
    LISP-LOCATIVE-TYPES because it doesn't need SOURCE-LOCATION.

      This also means that completion works for [CLHS][locative]
      definitions:

      - `\"lambda list<TAB>` lists `"lambda list"` and `"lambda list
        keywords"`, both HyperSpec glossary entries. This is similar
        to `common-lisp-hyperspec-glossary-term` in Elisp but also
        works for HyperSpec section titles.

      - `\"#<TAB>` lists all sharpsign reader macros (similar to
        `common-lisp-hyperspec-lookup-reader-macro` in Elisp).

      - `\"~<TAB>` lists all CL:FORMAT directives (similar to
        `common-lisp-hyperspec-format` in Elisp).

      - `\"loop:~<TAB>` lists all [loop keywords][clhs].

  - It works in non-`lisp-mode` buffers by reinterpreting a few lines
    of text surrounding point as lisp code (hence the suggested
    _global_ binding).

  - It supports fragment syntax at the prompt:

          NAME LOCATIVE FRAGMENT-NAME FRAGMENT-LOCATIVE

      This is like `NAME LOCATIVE`, but the browser scrolls to the
      definition of `FRAGMENT-NAME FRAGMENT-LOCATIVE` within that
      page.

      For example, entering this at the prompt will generate the
      entire PAX manual as a single page and scroll to the very
      section you are reading within it:

          pax::@pax-manual pax:section pax::@browsing-live-documentation pax:section

  - If the empty string is entered at the prompt, and there is no
    existing w3m buffer or w3m is not used, then @PAX-LIVE-HOME-PAGE
    is visited. If there is a w3m buffer, then entering the empty
    string displays that buffer.

  The convenience function
  `mgl-pax-current-definition-toggle-view` (`C-c C-d c`) documents the
  definition with point in it."""

  """When the value of the Elisp variable `mgl-pax-browser-function`
  is `w3m-browse-url` (see @EMACS-SETUP), the Emacs w3m browser is
  used without the need for a web server, and also offering somewhat
  tighter integration than @BROWSING-WITH-OTHER-BROWSERS.

  With @W3M-KEY-BINDINGS, moving the cursor between links involves
  `TAB` and `S-TAB` (or `<up>` and `<down>`). `RET` and `<right>`
  follow a link, while `B` and `<left>` go back in history.

  In addition, the following PAX-specific key bindings are available:

  - `\\M-.` visits the source location of the definition corresponding
    to the link under the point.

  - Invoking `mgl-pax-document` on a section title link will show the
    documentation of that section on its own page.

  - `n` moves to the next PAX definition on the page.

  - `p` moves to the previous PAX definition on the page.

  - `u` follows the first `Up:` link (to the first containing
    [SECTION][class]) if any.

  - `U` is like `u` but positions the cursor at the top of the page.

  - `v` visits the source location of the current definition (the one
    under the cursor or the first one above it).

  - `V` visits the source location of the first definition on the
    page.

  """When the value of the Elisp variable `mgl-pax-browser-function`
  is not `w3m-browse-url` (see @EMACS-SETUP), requests are served via
  a web server started in the running Lisp, and documentation is most
  likely displayed in a separate browser window.

  By default, `mgl-pax-browser-function` is `nil`, which makes PAX use
  `browse-url-browser-function`. You may want to customize the related
  `browse-url-new-window-flag` or, for Chrome, set
  `browse-url-chrome-arguments` to `("--new-window")`.

  By default, `mgl-pax-web-server-port` is `nil`, and PAX will pick a
  free port automatically.

  In the browser, clicking on the locative on the left of the
  name (e.g. in `- [function] PRINT`) will raise and focus the Emacs
  window (if Emacs is not in text mode, and also subject to window
  manager focus stealing settings), then go to the corresponding
  source location. For sections, clicking on the lambda link will do
  the same (see *DOCUMENT-FANCY-HTML-NAVIGATION*).

  Finally, note that the URLs exposed by the web server are subject to
  change, and even the port used may vary by session if the Elisp
  variable `mgl-pax-web-server-port` is nil."""

  "The Elisp functions `mgl-pax-apropos`, `mgl-pax-apropos-all`, and
  `mgl-pax-apropos-package` can display the results of DREF-APROPOS in
  the [live documentation browser] [@browsing-live-documentation].
  These extend the functionality of `slime-apropos`,
  `slime-apropos-all` and `slime-apropos-package` to support more
  kinds of DREF::@DEFINITIONs in an extensible way. The correspondence
  is so close that the PAX versions might [take over the Slime key
  bindings][@EMACS-SETUP].

  Note that apropos functionality is also exposed via the
  @PAX-LIVE-HOME-PAGE.

  More concretely, the PAX versions supports the following extensions:

  - Definitions with string names. One can search for
    [ASDF:SYSTEMs][locative], [PACKAGEs][locative] and
    [CLHS][locative] sections, glossary entries, format directives,
    reader macro characters, loop keywords.

  - Exact or substring matching of the name and the package.

  - Matching only symbol or string names.

  On the @PAX-LIVE-HOME-PAGE, one may @BROWSE-BY-LOCATIVE-TYPE, which
  gives access to some of the apropos functionality via the browser
  without involving Emacs.

  On the result page:

  - A DREF-APROPOS form to reproduce the results at the REPL is shown.

  - One may toggle the EXTERNAL-ONLY and CASE-SENSITIVE boolean
    arguments.

  - One may switch between list, and detailed view. The list view only
    shows the first, [bulleted line][@output-details] for each
    definition, while the detailed view includes the full
    documentation of definitions with the exception of SECTIONs.

  - The returned references are presented in two groups: those with
    non-symbol and those with symbol @NAMEs. The non-symbol group is
    sorted by locative type then by name. The symbol group is sorted
    by name then by locative type.

  With `mgl-pax-apropos-all` and `mgl-pax-apropos-package` being
  simple convenience functions on top of `mgl-pax-apropos`, we only
  discuss the latter in detail here. For the others, see the Elisp
  docstrings."
