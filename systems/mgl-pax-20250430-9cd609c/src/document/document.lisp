;;; - COLLECT-HEADINGs,
;;; - populate PAGE-DEFINITIONS,
;;; - set PAGE-WRITTEN-Ps.
;;;
;;; In the 2nd pass, output goes to the real output stream(s) (see
;;; PAGE-TEMP-STREAM-SPEC), and with the information gathered in the
;;; first pass, we may
;;;
;;; - PRINT-TOPLEVEL-SECTION-LIST for each PAGE-WRITTEN-P,
;;; - PRINT-TABLE-OF-CONTENTS for top-level sections,
;;; - add prev/next/up links to sections (FANCY-NAVIGATION),
;;; - know what definitions are @LINKABLE.
;;;
;;; In the 2.5th pass, we add markdown reference link definitions,
;;; headers, footers, and convert markdown to other formats if
;;; necessary.

(defsection @pages (:title "PAGES")
  """The PAGES argument of DOCUMENT is to create multi-page documents
  by routing some of the generated output to files, strings or
  streams. PAGES is a list of page specification elements. A page spec
  is a [property list][clhs] with keys :OBJECTS, :OUTPUT,
  :URI-FRAGMENT, :SOURCE-URI-FN, :HEADER-FN and :FOOTER-FN. OBJECTS is
  a list of objects (references are allowed but not required) whose
  documentation is to be sent to :OUTPUT.

  PAGES may look something like this:

  ```
  `((;; The section about SECTIONs and everything below it ...
     :objects (, @sections)
     ;; ... is so boring that it's not worth the disk space, so
     ;; send it to a string.

     ;; Explicitly tell other pages not to link to these guys.
     :uri-fragment nil)
    ;; Send the @EXTENSION-API section and everything reachable
    ;; from it ...
    (:objects (, @extension-api)
     ;; ... to build/tmp/pax-extension-api.html.
     :output "build/tmp/pax-extension-api.html"
     ;; However, on the web server html files will be at this
     ;; location relative to some common root, so override the
     ;; default:
     :uri-fragment "doc/dev/pax-extension-api.html"
     ;; Set html page title, stylesheet, charset.
     :header-fn 'write-html-header
     ;; Just close the body.
     :footer-fn 'write-html-footer)
    ;; Catch references that were not reachable from the above. It
    ;; is important for this page spec to be last.
    (:objects (, @pax-manual)
     :output "build/tmp/manual.html"
     ;; Links from the extension api page to the manual page will
     ;; be to ../user/pax-manual#<anchor>, while links going to
     ;; the opposite direction will be to
     ;; ../dev/pax-extension-api.html#<anchor>.
     :uri-fragment "doc/user/pax-manual.html"
     :header-fn 'write-html-header
     :footer-fn 'write-html-footer))
  ```

  Documentation is initially sent to a default stream (the STREAM
  argument of DOCUMENT), but output is redirected if the thing being
  currently documented is the :OBJECT of a PAGE-SPEC.

  - :OUTPUT can be a number things:

      - If it's NIL, then output will be collected in a string.

      - If it's T, then output will be sent to *STANDARD-OUTPUT*.

      - If it's a stream, then output will be sent to that stream.

      - If it's a list whose first element is a string or a pathname, then
        output will be sent to the file denoted by that and the rest of
        the elements of the list are passed on to CL:OPEN. One extra
        keyword argument is :ENSURE-DIRECTORIES-EXIST. If it's true,
        ENSURE-DIRECTORIES-EXIST will be called on the pathname before
        it's opened.

      Note that even if PAGES is specified, STREAM acts as a catch all,
      absorbing the generated documentation for references not claimed by
      any pages.

  - :HEADER-FN, if not NIL, is a function of a single stream argument,
    which is called just before the first write to the page. Since
    :FORMAT :HTML only generates HTML fragments, this makes it
    possible to print arbitrary headers, typically setting the title,
    CSS stylesheet, or charset.

  - :FOOTER-FN is similar to :HEADER-FN, but it's called after the
     last write to the page. For HTML, it typically just closes the
     body.

  - :URI-FRAGMENT is a string such as `"doc/manual.html"` that specifies
    where the page will be deployed on a webserver. It defines how
    links between pages will look. If it's not specified and :OUTPUT
    refers to a file, then it defaults to the name of the file. If
    :URI-FRAGMENT is NIL, then no links will be made to or from that
    page.

  - :SOURCE-URI-FN is a function of a single, [DREF][class] argument.
    If it returns a value other than NIL, then it must be a string
    representing an \URI. This affects *DOCUMENT-MARK-UP-SIGNATURES*
    and *DOCUMENT-FANCY-HTML-NAVIGATION*. Also see
    MAKE-GIT-SOURCE-URI-FN.""")

  """A list of versions of PAX \URL formats to support in the
  generated documentation. The first in the list is used to generate
  links.

  PAX emits HTML anchors before the documentation of SECTIONs
  (see @LINKING-TO-SECTIONS) and other things (see @LINKING). For the
  function `FOO`, in the current version (version 2), the anchor is
  `<a id="MGL-PAX:FOO%20FUNCTION">`, and its \URL will end
  with `\\#MGL-PAX:FOO%20FUNCTION`.

  _Note that to make the \URL independent of whether a symbol is
  [internal or external][find-symbol] to their SYMBOL-PACKAGE, single
  colon is printed where a double colon would be expected. Package and
  symbol names are both printed verbatim except for escaping colons
  and spaces with a backslash. For exported symbols with no funny
  characters, this coincides with how PRIN1 would print the symbol,
  while having the benefit of making the \URL independent of the Lisp
  printer's escaping strategy and producing human-readable output for
  mixed-case symbols. No such promises are made for non-ASCII
  characters, and their \URLs may change in future versions. Locatives
  are printed with PRIN1._

  Version 1 is based on the more strict HTML4 standard and the id of
  `FOO` is `"x-28MGL-PAX-3A-3AFOO-20FUNCTION-29"`. This is supported
  by GitHub-flavoured Markdown. Version 2 has minimal clutter and is
  obviously preferred. However, in order not to break external links,
  by default, both anchors are generated.

  Let's understand the generated Markdown.

  ```

    it is @INTERESTING.

  - One backslash right after an opening backtick turns autolinking
