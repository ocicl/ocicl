  """_What if definitions were first-class objects?_

  Some [defining forms][clhs] do not create first-class
  [objects][(clhs glossary-term)]. For example, DEFUN creates
  [FUNCTION][class] objects, but DEFVAR does not create variable
  objects as no such thing exists. The main purpose of this library is
  to fill this gap with the introduction of [DREF][class] objects:

  ```cl-transcript
  (defvar *my-var* nil
    "This is my var.")
  (dref '*my-var* 'variable)
  ==> #<DREF *MY-VAR* VARIABLE>
  ```

  DREFs just package up a @NAME (`\*MY-VAR*`) and a
  @LOCATIVE ([VARIABLE][locative]) then check that the definition
  actually exists:

  ```cl-transcript
  (dref 'junk 'variable)
  .. debugger invoked on LOCATE-ERROR:
  ..   Could not locate JUNK VARIABLE.
  ```

  The @BASIC-OPERATIONS on definitions in DRef are ARGLIST, DOCSTRING
  and SOURCE-LOCATION.

  ```cl-transcript
  (docstring (dref '*my-var* 'variable))
  => "This is my var."
  ```

  For definitions associated with objects, the definition can be
  LOCATEd from the object:

  ```cl-transcript
  (locate #'print)
  ==> #<DREF PRINT FUNCTION>
  ```

  These objects designate their definitions, so `(DOCSTRING #'PRINT)`
  works. Extending DRef and these operations is possible through
  DREF-EXT::@DEFINING-LOCATIVE-TYPES. It is also possible to define
  new operations. For example, [\\PAX][MGL-PAX::@PAX-MANUAL] makes
  PAX:DOCUMENT extensible through PAX:DOCUMENT-OBJECT*.

  Finally, existing definitions can be queried with DEFINITIONS and
  DREF-APROPOS:

  ```
  (definitions 'dref-ext:locate*)
  ==> (#<DREF LOCATE* GENERIC-FUNCTION>
  -->  #<DREF LOCATE* (METHOD NIL (GLOSSARY-TERM))>
  -->  #<DREF LOCATE* (METHOD NIL (SECTION))>
  -->  #<DREF LOCATE* (METHOD NIL (READTABLE))>
  -->  #<DREF LOCATE* (METHOD NIL (PACKAGE))>
  -->  #<DREF LOCATE* (METHOD NIL (ASDF/SYSTEM:SYSTEM))>
  -->  #<DREF LOCATE* (METHOD NIL (CLASS))>
  -->  #<DREF LOCATE* (METHOD NIL (METHOD))>
  -->  #<DREF LOCATE* (METHOD NIL (GENERIC-FUNCTION))>
  -->  #<DREF LOCATE* (METHOD NIL (FUNCTION))>
  -->  #<DREF LOCATE* (METHOD (:AROUND) (T))>
  -->  #<DREF LOCATE* (METHOD NIL (T))> #<DREF LOCATE* (METHOD NIL (XREF))>
  -->  #<DREF LOCATE* (METHOD NIL (DREF))>)
  ```

  ```cl-transcript
  (dref-apropos 'locate-error :package :dref)
  ==> (#<DREF LOCATE-ERROR CONDITION> #<DREF LOCATE-ERROR FUNCTION>)

  (dref-apropos "ate-err" :package :dref :external-only t)
