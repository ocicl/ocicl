  """Declare [LOCATIVE-TYPE][argument] as a [LOCATIVE][locative],
  which is the first step in DREF-EXT::@EXTENDING-DREF.

  - _Simple example_

      To define a locative type called `DUMMY` that takes no arguments
      and is not a locative subtype of any other locative type:

      ```
      (define-locative-type dummy ()
        "Dummy docstring.")
      ```

      With this definition, only the locatives `DUMMY` and its
      equivalent form `(DUMMY)` are valid. The above defines a DREF
      subclass called `DUMMY-DREF` in the current package. All
      definitions with locative type `DUMMY` and its locatives
      subtypes must be instances of `DUMMY-DREF`.

      `(LOCATE 'DUMMY 'LOCATIVE)` refers to this definition. That is,
      ARGLIST, [DOCSTRING][function] and SOURCE-LOCATION all work on
      it.

  - _Complex example_

      `DUMMY` may have arguments `X` and `Y` and inherit from locative
      types `L1` and `L2`:

      ```
      (define-locative-type (dummy x &key y) (l1 l2)
        "Dummy docstring."
        (defclass dummy-dref ()
          ((xxx :initform nil :accessor dummy-xxx))))
      ```

      One may change name of `DUMMY-DREF`, specify superclasses and
      add slots as with DEFCLASS. Behind the scenes, the DREF classes
      of `L1` and `L2` are added automatically to the list of
      superclasses.

  Arguments:

  - The general form of LOCATIVE-TYPE-AND-LAMBDA-LIST
    is (LOCATIVE-TYPE &REST LAMBDA-LIST), where LOCATIVE-TYPE is a
    SYMBOL, and LAMBDA-LIST is a [destructuring lambda list][clhs].
    The LOCATIVE-ARGS of [DREF][class]s with @LOCATIVE-TYPE
    LOCATIVE-TYPE (the argument given to this macro) always conform to
    this lambda list. See CHECK-LOCATIVE-ARGS.

      If LOCATIVE-TYPE-AND-LAMBDA-LIST is a single symbol, then that's
      interpreted as LOCATIVE-TYPE, and LAMBDA-LIST is NIL.

  - LOCATIVE-SUPERTYPES is a list of @LOCATIVE-TYPEs whose
    DREF-CLASSes are added to prepended to the list of superclasses
    this definition.

  upcast the returned value to the DREF argument's DREF-LOCATIVE-TYPE.

  - _Implementation note_

      The purpose of this rule is to allow DTYPEP answer this correctly:

      ```cl-transcript (:dynenv dref-std-env)
      (defclass foo ()
        ((a :accessor foo-a)))
      (dref '(setf foo-a) '(method () (t foo)))

      (dtypep * '(method () (t foo)))

      ;; Internally, DTYPEP upcast #<DREF FOO-A (ACCESSOR FOO)>
      ;; and checks that the locative args of the resulting
      ;; definition match those in (METHOD () (T FOO)).
      (locate* ** 'method)
      ==> #<DREF (SETF FOO-A) (METHOD NIL (T FOO))>
      ```

      For even more background, also note that if the name remains the
      same but locative args change, then DTYPEP can simply check with
      [DREF][function] if there is a definition of the name with the
      given locative:

      ```cl-transcript (:dynenv dref-std-env)
      (defclass foo ()
        ((r :reader foo-r)))
      (dref 'foo-r '(reader foo))
      ==> #<DREF FOO-R (READER FOO)>
      (dtypep * '(method () (foo)))
      => T
      ;; Behind the scenes, DTYPEP does this:
