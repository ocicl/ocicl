  """See if DREF is of DTYPE.

  - _[Atomic locatives][@locative]:_ If DTYPE is a @LOCATIVE-TYPE,
    then it matches definitions with that locative type and its
    locative subtypes.

      Because [CONSTANT][locative] is defined with VARIABLE among its
      [ LOCATIVE-SUPERTYPES] [ define-locative-type]:

      ```cl-transcript (:dynenv dref-std-env)
      (dtypep (dref 'pi 'constant) 'variable)
      => T
      ```

      ```cl-transcript (:dynenv dref-std-env)
      (dtypep (dref 'number 'class) 'type)
      => T
      ```

      It is an error if DTYPE is an ATOM but is not a @LOCATIVE-TYPE,
      but (the empty) argument list of bare locative types are not
      checked even if having no arguments makes them [invalid
      locatives][@locative].

  - _[Compound locatives][@locative]:_ Locatives in their compound
    form are validated and must match exactly (under EQUAL, as in
    XREF=).

      ```cl-transcript
      (defparameter *d* (dref 'dref* '(method () (t t t))))
      (defparameter *d2* (dref 'dref* '(method (:around) (t t t))))
      (dtypep *d* 'method)
      => T
      (dtypep *d* '(method))
      .. debugger invoked on SIMPLE-ERROR:
      ..   Bad arguments NIL for locative METHOD with lambda list
      ..   (METHOD-QUALIFIERS METHOD-SPECIALIZERS).
      (dtypep *d* '(method () (t t t)))
      => T
      (dtypep *d2* '(method () (t t t)))
      => NIL
      ```

  - DTYPE may be constructed with [AND][type], [OR][type] and
    [NOT][type] from Lisp types, locative types, full locatives and
    named DTYPEs:

      ```cl-transcript (:dynenv dref-std-env)
      (dtypep (dref 'locate-error 'condition) '(or condition class))
      => T
      (dtypep (dref nil 'type) '(and type (not class)))
      => T
      ```

  - For `(MEMBER &REST OBJS)`, each of OBJS is LOCATEd and DREF is
    matched against them with XREF=:

      ```cl-transcript (:dynenv dref-std-env)
      (dtypep (locate #'print) `(member ,#'print))
      => T
      ```

  - For `(SATISFIES PRED)`, the predicate PRED is funcalled with DREF.

  - DTYPE may be named by DEFINE-DTYPE:

      ```cl-transcript (:dynenv dref-std-env)
      (dtypep (locate #'car) 'top)
      => T

;;;; types out) since the set of all definitions is at least in the
;;;; tens of thousands. So, we query like this:
;;;;
;;;; 1. COVER-DTYPE gives a set of locative types whose union contains
;;;;    all definitions of DTYPE, but this upper bound may be loose
;;;;    when a locative's args restrict a locative type further as in
;;;;    (METHOD () (NUMBER)).
;;;;
;;;; 2. We gather all definitions with these locative types.
;;;;
;;;; 3. FILTER-DREFS-BY-DTYPE discards the definitions that are not of
;;;;    DTYPE (possible if the upper bound is loose).
