  """Return a list of [DREF][class]s corresponding to existing
  definitions that match the various arguments. First, `(DREF-APROPOS
  NIL)` lists all definitions in the running Lisp and maybe more (e.g.
  [MGL-PAX:CLHS][locative]). Arguments specify how the list of
  definitions is filtered.

  DREF-APROPOS itself is similar to CL:APROPOS-LIST, but

  - it finds @DEFINITIONs not SYMBOLs,
  - it supports an extensible definition types, and
  - filtering based on them.

  PAX has a live browsing [frontend][PAX::@APROPOS].

  Roughly speaking, when NAME or PACKAGE is a SYMBOL, they must match
  the whole @NAME of the definition:

  ```cl-transcript
  (dref-apropos 'method :package :dref :external-only t)
  ==> (#<DREF METHOD CLASS> #<DREF METHOD LOCATIVE>)
  ```

  On the other hand, when NAME or PACKAGE is a STRING, they are
  matched as substrings to the definition's name PRINC-TO-STRINGed:

  ```cl-transcript
  (dref-apropos "method" :package :dref :external-only t)
  ==> (#<DREF SETF-METHOD LOCATIVE> #<DREF METHOD CLASS>
  -->  #<DREF METHOD LOCATIVE> #<DREF METHOD-COMBINATION CLASS>
  -->  #<DREF METHOD-COMBINATION LOCATIVE>)
  ```

  Definitions that are not of DTYPE (see DTYPEP) are filtered out:

  ```cl-transcript
  (dref-apropos "method" :package :dref :external-only t :dtype 'class)
  ==> (#<DREF METHOD CLASS> #<DREF METHOD-COMBINATION CLASS>)
  ```

  When PACKAGE is :NONE, only non-symbol @NAMES are matched:

  ```
  (dref-apropos "dref" :package :none)
  ==> (#<DREF "DREF" PACKAGE> #<DREF "DREF-EXT" PACKAGE>
  -->  #<DREF "DREF-TEST" PACKAGE> #<DREF "dref" ASDF/SYSTEM:SYSTEM>
  -->  #<DREF "dref/full" ASDF/SYSTEM:SYSTEM>
  -->  #<DREF "dref/test" ASDF/SYSTEM:SYSTEM>
  -->  #<DREF "dref/test-autoload" ASDF/SYSTEM:SYSTEM>)
  ```

  The exact rules of filtering are as follows. Let `C` be the @NAME of
  the candidate definition from the list of all definitions that we
  are matching against the arguments and denote its string
  representation `(PRINC-TO-STRING C)` with `P`. Note that
  PRINC-TO-STRING does not print the package of symbols. We say that
  two strings _match_ if CASE-SENSITIVE is NIL and they are EQUALP, or
  CASE-SENSITIVE is true and they are EQUAL. CASE-SENSITIVE affects
  _substring_ comparisons too.

  - If NAME is a SYMBOL, then its SYMBOL-NAME must _match_ `P`.

  - If NAME is a STRING, then it must be a _substring_ of `P`.

  - If PACKAGE is :ANY, then `C` must be a SYMBOL.

  - If PACKAGE is :NONE, then `C` must _not_ be a SYMBOL.

  - If PACKAGE is not NIL, :ANY or :NONE, then `C` must be a symbol.

  - If PACKAGE is a [PACKAGE][class], it must be EQ to the
    SYMBOL-PACKAGE of `C`.

  - If PACKAGE is a SYMBOL other than NIL, :ANY and :NONE, then its
    SYMBOL-NAME must _match_ the PACKAGE-NAME or one of the
    PACKAGE-NICKNAMES of SYMBOL-PACKAGE of `C`.

  - If PACKAGE is a STRING, then it must be a _substring_ of the
    PACKAGE-NAME of SYMBOL-PACKAGE of `C`.

  - If EXTERNAL-ONLY and `C` is a symbol, then `C` must be external in
    a matching package.

  - DTYPE matches candidate definition `D` if `(DTYPEP D DTYPE)`.
